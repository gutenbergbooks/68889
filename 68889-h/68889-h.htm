</div>

<p>This book is written for the world of students.
In it any seriously-minded person should find a
fundamental background for understanding the
central theme of human progress, a substantial
basis for attacking the most important problems of
the day, and a call to renew his faith in the soundness
of human aspirations.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this treatise is written for students,
it is not intended to be the last word on the subject,
but simply a first word. The theme of each chapter
is in itself a subject for further investigation.
In fact, the student with an alert mind will find in
each chapter many subjects concerning which he
will want to learn more. If the discussions in this
book stimulate the student to make inquiries on his
own initiative, they will have accomplished more
than the author could have expected.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Nature of Social Thought</span></span></h2>

<p>Man faces a world of social problems. As a result
he is perplexed beyond description; his thinking
often ends in confusion. Inasmuch as the average
citizen, for the first time in the world’s history, is
beginning to attack social problems, he is entitled
to all the aid that can be made available. Upon the
success of the average person in mastering the intricacies
of social thinking, the cause of democracy
depends.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the analyses of social
questions has been academic. These discussions
have often terminated in quibbles or erudite generalizations.
Insofar as social theories have been
correct they have unfortunately been reserved for
the theorists alone. The people themselves have
not understood the nature of social thought; they
have not benefited; and hence, they have held social
thought in contempt. Sound social thought needs
to be democratized, that is, to be made available for
all people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>In thinking about social problems, the so-called
practical person has proceeded in his own way. He
has had personal experience—and that to him has
been sufficient. He has been motivated by a sense
of injustice, and stung into fervid thought by circumstances
which seemed to him unfair; he has
concocted a make-shift remedy, or impulsively accepted
a ready-made program. Perhaps he has
urged a single cause for all social ills and prescribed
a single remedy for all social diseases.
Usually, he has been very limited in his observations,
untrained in making proper inductions, and
hence, narrow and intolerant in his conclusions.
He has been entirely baffled, or else he has felt
cock-sure.</p>

<p>The practicalist is often a poor theorist. He
may be even the most dangerous type of theorist.
He has scoffed at theory and then fallen into the
pit of incorrect theory. He has failed to see, for
example, that a good bridge does not project itself
across a chasm, but that a correct bridge-building
theory is essential. With social practicalists and
theorists calling each other names, instead of co-operating
and unselfishly giving the world of people
the benefit of their combined points of view, the
world has floundered and its social problems have
piled up, mountains high.</p>

<p>Another difficulty in the pathway of sound social
thinking is found in an absence of proper backgrounds.
People are prone to offer solutions for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
social questions without first equipping themselves
with a knowledge of foundational elements. Moreover,
they are often unwilling to acquaint themselves
with these necessary factors. It is only by
accident, however, that current social movements
can be understood unless the historical sequences
of social cause and effect are perceived. Nearly all
social problems are essentially the outcroppings of
tendencies which have had a long human history.
A current social maladjustment is generally indicative
of a long line of antecedent factors. A knowledge
of societary fundamentals is essential to sound
thinking about present-day evils. A history of
social thought furnishes a minimum social background
for the understanding of current social
processes and problems.</p>

<p>Social thought, as distinguished from individual
thought, treats of the welfare of one’s associates
and of groups. It may be very simple, merely observational,
the result of daily experience, or it may
be a scientific study of social processes. Sociology
as an organized science has developed only during
the past few decades. Inasmuch as sociology has
simply begun its work of formulating the principles
of societary progress, a large proportion of the
thinking that has thus far been done in human history
about the welfare of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">socii</i> or associates is
either individual or social, rather than sociological.
A history of social thought, therefore, includes the
larger social field as well as the more specific one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of recent development, namely, the sociological.
The time is hardly ripe for a history of distinctly
sociological thought.</p>

<p>Social thought, as here used, is a synthesis of
the observations of individuals about the welfare
of other individuals, considered as individuals or as
groups. The focus of social thought is not the welfare
of the ego but of the alter, not of the self but
of others, not of the individual but of the class,
group, organization, or process. Social thought
draws from the thought-life of persons who have
done unselfish thinking and who have focalized
their attention upon the nature and principles of
associative activities. It tests group progress by
the degree in which human personalities secure
constructive, co-operative expression. It measures
the individual in his relationships to the social
whole, whether that unit be the family, school,
church, state, or the world society. It rates the individual
in terms of a functioning unit in group
life. It evaluates the group both in regard to the
quality of the personalities which it produces in its
membership, and to the loyalty which it manifests
as a unit of a larger group, even of human society
itself.</p>

<p>Social thought is both concrete and abstract.
Concrete thinking rarely goes deep. It asks few
questions, raises few doubts, and perceives few
connections. Abstract thinking seeks causal explanations,
classifies concretenesses, penetrates relationships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and proposes well-balanced procedures.
The distinction, however, is largely one of degree.
Concrete thinking is characteristic of every normal
person, but abstract perceptions are uncommon.
The ability to do abstract thinking, to get at the
deeper meanings of phenomena, to penetrate the
mysteries of life, is rare. Concrete thinking constitutes
the major sector of the thought-life of
every person, nearly all the time.</p>

<p>Here and there, however, in human history we
find individuals who have been freed or who have
freed themselves from the daily struggle for a living,
from the race to make money, or from the
selfish enticements of life-long loafing, and have
joined the world of scholars, seeking to know the
truth, the truth which makes men and women
free—free to develop useful personalities in a vast,
changing complex of human living. When man,
having leisure to think abstractly, has set himself
to the task of thought research, his mind has ventured
along at least five pathways.</p>

<p>(1) Man has given considerable attention to
his relation to the universe. Primitive man conceived
of a personal universe, peopled with spirits.
Throughout human history man has been a religious
being, trying to solve the problems of a
universe ruled by spirits and gods or by one supreme
God. This type of thought has produced
polytheisms, monotheisms, theocracies. It has formulated
theological creeds and led to bitter ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
controversies. It has created fears, hopes,
faiths, social ideals, and sacrificial standards.</p>

<p>(2) Irrespective of religious needs, man has
endeavored to discover proper relations to his universe.
He has philosophized. He has tried to reduce
to terms of thought this baffling, intangible,
universal environment. He has searched for a
specific ground for explaining the universe. He
has sought unity in change and monism in multiplicity.
He has proclaimed that change itself is
Lord of the universe, or perhaps he has found
solace in a creative evolution. At any rate, he has
sought ultimate meanings in as unbiased an interpretation
of the universe as is humanly possible.</p>

<p>(3) From the far-flung horizons of religious
and philosophic theory, man has turned his thought
in an opposite direction—he has directed his
thought upon itself. He has maneuvered his
thought processes introspectively. He has puzzled
over the structure and functions of his own mind.
These series of studies have led on the one hand
to treatises such as the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>,
and on the other hand to the current expressions
of behavioristic psychology or of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>(4) Man has sought to fathom the material
secrets of the earth. Since the Industrial Revolution
in England, inquiring minds have focussed
tremendous energies upon attempts to master the
physical elements. Rocks and strata of rocks have
been caused to yield a wealth of ores, and subterranean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
caverns have been made to pour forth reservoirs
of gas and oil. Modern transportation has
been made possible by the use of steam, gasoline,
electricity. Mechanical inventions have followed
one another in unanticipated fashion, paying awe-inspiring
tribute to the genius of man. Abstract
thinking has given man a marvelous degree of control
over the material side of life.</p>

<p>(5) Recently, the problem of man’s adjustment
and responsibility to his fellowmen is being accorded
a worthy hearing at the bar of scientific
thought. For millenniums man has pondered hard
over his relations and obligations to his God and to
his universe, over the nature of his mind and spirit,
over ways and means of acquiring individual success
through a manipulation of the material resources
of the earth. Incomprehensible as it may
seem, it is true, however, that man has neglected
almost wholly, until recently, the very heart of all
successful living, namely, his relations and obligations
to his fellow men and to society. Social
thought, the center of all sound thinking, has been
ignored. Consequently, the world, beneath its load
of social ills, has slipped backward nearly as often
as it has advanced.</p>

<p>In the present age, however, the world is making
unprecedented demands upon social thought, long
before social thought is adequately prepared for its
gigantic tasks. Religion is seeking re-vitalization
through socialized thinking. In its modern endeavor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
to win the world, Christianity is making tremendous
demands upon applied sociology.</p>

<p>After many vain searches among false theories
and impersonal ends, philosophy is seeking to find
itself in a social universe. Psychology, likewise, is
no longer individual, structural, and formal; it is
now trying to interpret itself in terms of human
behavior. Group processes are being searched for
the origins of stimuli that will explain individual
conduct.</p>

<p>Economic thought, too, has reached a stage
where it is endeavoring to re-define its concepts in
the light of sociological knowledge. The material
resources of the earth as well as industrial and
business enterprises, in fact all economic values, are
being measured, and re-valued in terms of their
societary significance. The meaning of industrial
democracy is being sought in sociological terms.</p>

<p>In the distinctively associative life enormous demands
are being made upon sociology. It is invited
to formulate the criteria by which the worth of an
educational system may be determined. Groups are
trying to provide for the use of the leisure time of
their members by methods that are socially valuable.
Many attempts are being made for restoring
to the family its fundamental prerogatives as a

<p>The history of social thought rises out of the beginnings
of human life on earth and with jagged
edges extends along the full sweep of the changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
historical horizon. It finds expression through
some of the world’s best minds. Our quest will
bring us in contact with the most vital moments of
the world’s most valuable thinkers.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Earliest Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Primitive people were inquisitive. They thought
about what happened and they sought explanations.
Their attention was centered on the tangible
phenomena of life. Their imagination worked out
fantastic and superstitious interpretations. They
reasoned about the daily occurrences of life in concrete,
graphic, and personal terms.</p>

<p>Primitive people everywhere, apparently, sensed
in a piecemeal and microscopic way the meaning
of social relationships. Archeological records disclose
crude and simple, but nevertheless genuine
social implications. Early mythologies recognize
the importance of social bonds. Out of the dim
dawn of tribal life there appeared a rough-hewn
sense of social property. The proverbs of primitive
people include implications, if not definite statements,
of social responsibility.</p>

<p>Primitive people lived simple group lives. If the
paternal relationship was not always known or
recognized, the maternal relationship functioned
for at least a few years. The loose family ties harbored
a degree of social responsibility. Wherever
ancestor worship developed, the family group assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
large proportions and manifested strong
social characteristics. The clan, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">gens</i>, betokened
social fealty.</p>

<p>Communal property testified to communal thinking.
The existence of common hunting grounds
and tribal flocks was indicative of folk thought.
Group dances, feasts, building enterprises, celebrations
delineated the social spirit. Warfare produced
bursts of tribal loyalty. An examination of
the folkways reveals indistinct but incipient notions
of societal welfare. Such a treatise as Sumner’s
<i>Folkways</i> chronicles a vast amount of elemental
folk thinking.</p>

<p>Folk thinking permeated primitive religions. The
earliest forms of religion presupposed societies of
spirits or gods. The conduct of the individual was
regulated by his ideas concerning the ways in which
he had pleased or offended the spirits or gods. An
infant was born into a society peopled with human
and spirit beings. The latter were often more
numerous than the former; they frequently were
more feared; and hence were more powerful. The
living people, the departed spirits, and the gods in a
hierarchal order constituted an effective society for
the exercise of many vigorous forms of social
control.</p>

<p>If pestilence came, it was because the gods had
been offended by some human being. As a result
of the offense of one individual, the whole tribe
was considered to be liable to punishment. Consequently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the tribe in turn would punish the offending
member and through the use of force and fear
would exert a tremendous power over the conduct
and thought of individuals.</p>

<p>Primitive people were dominated by custom.
They were subject to the autocracy of the past.
They were hopelessly caught between ancestral
ascendance and current fears. They threaded their
way, mentally, through tantalizingly uncertain and
narrow apertures. They learned the meaning of
obedience, but obedience to a harsh and rigorous
past and a fickle and disconcerting future. Leadership
was drastic and capricious; followership was
frantic and tremulous.</p>

<p>Some of the incipient social concepts of primitive
peoples have been preserved in the form of
proverbs, maxims, fables, and myths. Many of the
subtler social relationships of life were recognized
by early man. His limited thinking drifted into
simple formulae. His vocabulary was scanty; his
ideas were few. He spoke in conventional sayings.
“Primitive man spoke in proverbs.”</p>

<p>Many folkthoughts, or primitive conceptions of
social obligations, have been preserved. The early
proverbs of man reveal the beginnings of social
thought. Equally valuable and similar materials
are found in the sayings of the tribes which today
are in a state of arrested development. A few illustrations
of embryonic social thought will be given
here.<a id="FNanchor_II-1" href="#Footnote_II-1" class="fnanchor">II-1</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>The first examples will be selected from the folkthoughts
of the Africans of the Guinea Coast. The
proverb, Ashes fly back in the face of him who
throws them, recognizes that evil deeds return upon
the doer, or as moderns declare, Curses come home
to roost. In the saying, Cowries are men, primitive
man roughly but succinctly stated the theory
of the economic determination of human history. It
is cowries, or money, which molds human thought,
determines human evaluations and attitudes, gives
social power, and “makes the man.” An age-long
conception, indicative of a low sense of social
feeling, but possessing great force in society, is
revealed in the dictum, Full-belly child says to
hungry-belly child, “Keep good cheer.” Throughout
human history, the fortunate glutton has always
recommended patience and tranquility to the unfortunate,
hard-working brother. An eminent American
financier of the multi-millionaire class expressed
pity for telephone girls who undergo hard
labor, but declared that their harsh conditions were
what the good Lord had made for them. But how
far has this well-groomed citizen of our century
advanced beyond the “full-belly” social philosophy
of savage man?</p>

<p>In the observation, A fool of Ika and an idiot
of Iluka meet together to make friends, the African
has noted that friends are persons of similar
types, of similar minds, of similar prejudices, and
that “birds of a feather flock together.” Whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
conscious or unconscious, association occurs among
persons of a kind, among fools of Ika and idiots
of Iluka.</p>

<p>Romantic love, evidently, has always been fickle,
for the African has discovered that “quick loving
a woman means quick not loving a woman.” If
this naïve but shrewd reflection concerning lovemaking
were taken at its real worth at the present
time, it would be crystallized into a federal marriage
law requiring that a license to marry should
be obtained at least fifteen or thirty days before
the marriage could be celebrated.</p>

<p>A rather keen sense of social injustice is expressed
in the monologue: “The ground-pig said:
‘I do not feel so angry with the man who killed me
as with the man who dashed me on the ground
afterward.’” Here the injustice of striking an individual
when he is down is depicted. Even primitive
man has a sense of sympathy for the defeated
and helpless.</p>

<p>“Three elders cannot all fail to pronounce the
word <em>ekulu</em> (antelope): one may say <em>ekúlu</em>; another
<em>ekulú</em>; but the third will say, <em>ékulu</em> (which is correct).”
In other words, several heads are better
than one; or, in a multitude of counsellors there is
safety. It was this simple social precept which a
highly individualistic man like Roosevelt used frequently
to the advantage of himself and the nation.
When a perplexing problem would confront President
Roosevelt, he was wont to invite to the White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
House persons whose beliefs were contrary to his
own in order to secure their opinions. He acted
independently, but after taking counsel with several
“elders.”</p>

<p>In <i>Thinking Black</i>, Daniel Crawford has presented
phases of the colored man’s philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_II-2" href="#Footnote_II-2" class="fnanchor">II-2</a>
While much is individual, more is social philosophy.
Custom imitation prevails. The social philosophy
of the African Negro is summarized in the rule:
Follow your leader. Social precedent, not principle,
is the guide to conduct. If you are a follower, follow
patiently; if you are a leader, lead drastically.
“If thou art an anvil, be patient ... but if thou
art a hammer, strike hard.”</p>

<p>The African understands the social psychology
of language. He watches the eyes more carefully
than the voice. To him the human eye speaks all
languages under the sun. Mr. Crawford says that
the wary eye of the African “can easily fish news
out of the two deep liquid pools of your eye-balls.”
If your eye says one thing and your tongue another,
then the African “will plump for the verdict
of the eye.”</p>

<p>The aphorism, There is no pocket in a shroud,
warns the individual against the possibility of taking
his material goods into the next world. To
share with other persons is rated a higher act than
to store from others. He is richest who shares
most. Among the Africans with whom Mr. Crawford
worked, the word for criminal was not applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
to the person who had stolen property or who had
taken life, but to the one who eats alone. “The
high crime and misdemeanor of the town is to dine
alone;” the criminal above other criminals is “Mr.
Eat-Alone.” He who refuses to share his food
with those who are less fortunate than himself is
an arch-devil. Such a vice is common among
beasts; it is beneath the dignity of man—according
to the African. When several primitives were
taken to London and shown the wealthy and the
poor sections of that city, they were dumbfounded.
They were utterly unable to understand how any
persons with the slightest spark of human nature
in them could endure to live to themselves in wealth
when in the same city there were the wretched and
prostrated multitudes of Whitechapel and the other
cheerless slums.</p>

<p>“What baby lion ever trembled at his father’s
roaring?” A few mornings ago, I heard an angry
parent yelling at his son, but the disobedient child
kept on in his own way. I wondered how far this
father had advanced in parental influence and discipline
beyond the stage represented by the African
seer who drew his social images from a lion-frequented
environment. “If a tree has grown up
crooked, it is because no one straightened it when
young.” This statement postulates social responsibility
for juvenile delinquency and even for adult
crime. The underlying principle is the same as
that in the Hebraic injunction: Train up a child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
in the way he should go; and when he is old, he
will not depart from it. The principle has received
current recognition in the doctrine of contributory
negligence of parents. The modern observation
full of socially dangerous implications, that parents
are blind to the weaknesses of their children, has
its African counterpart: The beetle is a beauty
in the eyes of its mother. A gleam of light is
thrown upon the current discussions concerning
social parasitism by the African’s assertion: The
parasite has no roots.</p>

<p>The Australian Blackfellow who goes upon a
journey, sometimes takes a handful of mother earth
with him. In this way he testifies to his loyalty to
home, and provides against the rise of lonesomeness
which he will experience during tribal hunts.
His act crudely represents the essence of the concept
of patriotism. A sense of justice is common
to primitive Australians. Among the Whayook of
Australia a man who has wounded a fellow tribesman
is required to present himself to the injured
in order to receive a similar wound.<a id="FNanchor_II-3" href="#Footnote_II-3" class="fnanchor">II-3</a> Among the
Wumbais, a person who is absent when a relative
dies must not speak on his return to camp to anyone
until he has had spears thrown at him.<a id="FNanchor_II-4" href="#Footnote_II-4" class="fnanchor">II-4</a> Spencer
and Gillen report that the Australian primitive
regards any offense as wiped out by a suitable proffer
of atonement.<a id="FNanchor_II-5" href="#missing" class="fnanchor">II-5</a></p>

<p>The Filipino declares: A piece of green wood
will burn if placed near the fire. In other words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
temptation is a subtle element that ultimately may
destroy even persons who are supposedly temptation-proof.
In the proverb, Boastfulness drives
away wisdom, the Filipino has pointed out that the
desire to make a strong impression upon associates
hinders intellectual progress. The chief danger of
luxury is stated in the saying: He who is raised
in ease, is usually destitute. The leading result of
being financially fortunate is summarized thus:
Easy earning means quick spending. The evils of
hypercriticism are bluntly phrased: The fault-finder
has the biggest faults. The law of social
compensation is stated as follows: You laugh today;
I laugh tomorrow. The organic nature of
society is implied in the truism: The pain of a
finger is the suffering of the whole body. The
need for independent thinking is urged in the declaration:
Whoever believes everything said, has no
mind of his own. On the other hand, the egocentric
mind receives solemn warning in the dictum:
He who despises counsel is on the way to
misfortune. The value of a social spirit is proclaimed
as follows: Kindness is a great capital;
and again: Good deeds are more precious than
gold or silver. A gentle hint of social importance
is given in the formula: Kindness is with kindness
to be paid, not with gold or silver. In these and
related proverbs the earliest social thought of the
Filipino mind is indicated.</p>

<p>Let us now examine a few ancient Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
axioms. (1) The mouth of the mass melts gold.
This proverb refers to the fundamental force of
public opinion. (2) The world is like a looking-glass;
if you smile, others also smile. Here is depicted
the elemental character of unconscious imitation.
(3) What the ruler wants, the ruled also
wants. In other words, what the upper classes desire,
the lower classes long for; or, as Tarde has
said: “The superior are imitated by the inferior.”
(4) Three men get together and have knowledge
equivalent to that of Monju (a famous Buddhist
thinker). The African, Filipino, and English
equivalents of this adage have already been given.
All races, apparently, have early observed the
safety which comes from taking counsel. (5) The
net of Heaven is rough, but will never miss one
victim. Our equivalent, of Graeco-Latin origin, is:
The mills of the gods grind slowly, but exceedingly
small. Evil brings its own rewards sooner or later.
The law of retribution cannot be overcome, even
by social manipulations. (6) If one dog barks a
falsehood, ten thousand others spread it as a truth.
In these words, gossip is condemned, and the humanity-wide
tendency of hearsay evidence to gain
social force is pictured. (7) The tongue is but
three inches long, but it can kill a man six feet
high. Again, the vicious nature of gossip is shown.
Further, the severest punishment is not always
physical; it may come from the human tongue.
(8) A man takes a drink; then the drink takes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
man. In this dramatic description, the drinking of
intoxicating liquors is effectively indicted. (9) Applause
is the root of abuse. Even the Japanese
have recognized the force of opinion in influencing
the individual, and of favorable opinion in unduly
expanding the ego. A unique characteristic of
many Japanese proverbs is the fundamental and
deep-moving knowledge of social psychology which
they show. Judged by their proverbs, the Japanese
possess an unusual understanding of human nature.</p>

<p>Bulgarian proverbs disclose social thought. The
“full-belly” philosophy of the African, or the pig-trough
philosophy that has been analyzed by T.
N. Carver, has its Bulgarian counterpart: The
satiated man cannot believe the hungry man. The
South Slavs are noted for their weddings which
often continue for three days. When these festivities
are over, the bride enters upon a more or less
monotonous round of bearing and rearing children.
These social conditions are aptly described:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dum! Dum! for three days;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh dear! Oh dear! for all days.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Patience is enjoined in the Bulgarian adage:
Endure, O horse, until the time of green grass.
Hope that rises in the heart of man is paid homely
but genuine tribute in the rural Slavic proverb:
The hungry hen dreams of millet.</p>

<p>The Danes have many sayings which emphasize
social dependence. The individual is instructed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Act so in the valley that you need not fear those
that stand on the hill. The shrewd man is socially
dangerous, for: Cunning has little honor. Gossip
is shown as a swift messenger in the axiom: A
man’s character reaches town before his person.
The most serious result of cheating others is the
effect upon the cheater, or: He is most cheated
who cheats himself. The common character of sin
is recognized in the Danish proverb: He must be
pure who would blame another. Custom is a powerful
agency of control. The Danes command:
Follow the customs, or fly the country.</p>

<p>The Portuguese have a social saying to the effect:
He buys very dear who begs. The unscientific nature
of love is indicated in the Portuguese declaration:
Love has no law. The frequent antithesis
between money lending and friend making is succinctly
phrased: Money lent, an enemy made.</p>

<p>A few Arabian proverbs state social ideas. The
laws of human association and imitation can be
found in the following axiom: A wise man associating
with the vicious becomes an idiot; a dog
traveling with good men becomes a rational being.
The strength which comes from unity is forcibly
phrased: Three if they unite against a town will
ruin it. The transforming power of love is recognized:
Love can make any place agreeable. An
idealistic social standard is set for the individual in
the aphorism: It is more noble to pardon than to
punish. On the other hand, mercy may be misplaced:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Mercy to the criminal may be cruelty to
the people. The individual must beware of being
an ingrate; he must not permit his selfish desires
to crush out the spirit of gratitude: A tree that
affords thee shade, do not order it cut down. The
omnipresence of envy is understood: Envy assails
the noblest; the winds howl around the highest
peaks. The anti-social tendency of a vicious habit
is well described: A hand accustomed to take is
far from giving. Perhaps the Malthusian advocate
will find solace in the simple dictum: If the sailors
become too numerous, the boat will sink. He who
pleases everybody has done so at the expense of his
own character, or as the Arabs say: He deserves
no man’s good will of whom all men speak well.</p>

<p>From Ceylon comes the philanthropic request:
When you eat, think of the poor. The Cingalese,
however, recognize the importance of maintaining
the scientific attitude in charity, for they have a
saying: He who gives alms must do it with discretion.
The blighting influence of wealth is stated
in the Cingalese axiom: A covetous man has two
sources of iniquity—how to amass money, and how
to use it.</p>

<p>Among Mexican proverbs, social ideas are not
missing. The reader will catch the social significance
of the following: (1) A howling cat is not
a good hunter; (2) Everybody can climb up the
limbs of the fallen tree; (3) A rich widow cries
with one eye and rings the wedding bells with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
other; (4) The tongue slow, the eyes quick; (5)
From January to January the bankers have all the
money.</p>

<p>The illustrations which have been given from
several racial sources will suffice to show the nature
of the earliest social thought of primitive peoples.
By way of comparison, a few social proverbs which
are common among English, Scotch, French, and
German speaking peoples, and which are of various
origins, will be given. It will be unnecessary to
comment upon the social thought which is stated or
implied in these proverbs.</p>

</div>

<p>The nature of the primitive social thought that
has been preserved through proverbs and sayings
justifies the following observations. (1) Primitive
social thought was exceedingly simple, crude, and
undeveloped. (2) It was uncorrelated and unsystematic.
(3) A classification of the total number
of known proverbs of any primitive people into individual
and social types shows that not more than
ten per cent are social. Primitive thinking was
done in terms of the welfare of the individual himself.
The social thought was commonly of individualistic
origin. A social idea was originally not
suggested for its own sake or disinterestedly, but
for the reason that its observance would enable individuals
to live together more harmoniously and
prosperously. (4) Social proverbs employ figures
of speech. Similes from nature are frequent; physical
analogies are not uncommon. Many of these
figures disclose a rural or bucolic mind. (5) Frequently,
the social proverbs of the various races
pertain to family and community relationships.
The sense of social responsibility does not penetrate
as a rule beyond the small group. The responsibility
of group to group is rarely expressed or implied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
The social vision does not extend to large
groups. (6) A comparative study of primitive social
sayings indicates countless similarities, and testifies
to the uniformity of human experiences and
social needs, irrespective of racial distinctions.
These resemblances do not imply collaboration, collusion,
or imitation. They mean that the needs of
primitive individuals in various and unrelated parts
of the world have everywhere led the human mind
out in search of socially satisfactory explanations.
Primitive thinking produced fundamental social
concepts, such as kinship, authority, dependence,
and tribal loyalty.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Social Thought of Ancient Civilizations</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In this chapter the discussion of earliest social
thought will be presented from the standpoint of
the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Babylonia and
Assyria, India, China, and Persia. The evidences
of social thought are meagre and inchoate. Nevertheless,
there are data which cannot be ignored.
Inferential evidence and proverbial references constitute
the main portion of these data.</p>

<p>(1) The ancient Egyptian social order was
bureaucratic and autocratic. The king was supreme.
With the rise of the Theban hierarchy,
the priestly class came to power and established a
theocratic régime. Then military leaders came
into prominence and overthrew the theocracy of
the priests.</p>

<p>With the historical rise of Egypt, about 4000
B. C., the emphasis upon law as the basis of the
social order stands out prominently. The books of
laws early acquired sacred significance. They were
reputed to be of divine and monarchical origins;
they provided courts of justice; and they prescribed
punishments for offenses.</p>

<p>The social ideas are to be gleaned almost entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
from proverbial sayings. Egyptian scholars refer
to collections of these moral precepts as being of
a practical rather than a systematic philosophical
nature. The most frequently mentioned of the
Egyptian books of proverbs are the Proverbs of
Ptah-hotep, and the Prescriptions of Ani.</p>

<p>The social order was dominated as a rule by the
king, who was supposed to be divine. The king
and a relatively small number of nobles owned the
land. The large percentage of the people were
serfs and slaves. Throughout ancient Egyptian
history, the middle class must have been weak, and
small in numbers. When the lands passed under
the control of the temple authorities no change occurred
in the social conditions of the masses. The
priests shared the authority with their auxiliaries,
the soldiers. The unprivileged classes included the
farmers, boatmen, mechanics, trades-people, besides
the slaves.<a id="FNanchor_III-1" href="#Footnote_III-1" class="fnanchor">III-1</a></p>

<p>Egyptian life was rural. Commerce was undeveloped.
Higher education was reserved for the
very few, although it appears that elementary education
was widespread. The priests often used
their educational advantages to prey upon and excite
the superstitions of the people, thereby
strengthening the social control which they enjoyed.</p>

<p>An anomalous phase of the Egyptian mind was
that it shifted back and forth from a hedonistic
enjoyment of the moment to a serious contemplation
of the future life. Amusements were fostered;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the drinking of intoxicating liquors was extensive,
and music was promoted. The game of draughts
was perhaps the national pastime. The people
were not warriors. They employed mercenaries,
who ultimately became socially powerful.</p>

<p>Polygamy was countenanced and practised, but
only of course among the wealthy. A relatively
high degree of freedom was granted the women
among the privileged classes. They appeared in
public with their husbands; they publicly engaged
in religious ceremonies; and they were given unusual
property rights. At one time it is reported
that Egyptian women could not only own property,
but could dispose of it as they wished, or could loan
money at interest to their husbands. At another
time the following injunction seems to have been
issued: “Thou shalt never forget thy mother, and
what she has done for thee, that she bore thee, and
nurtured thee in all ways.” Children were enjoined
to obey their parents, to be respectful to
their superiors, and to be reserved. Greatness was
identified with kindness. Justice and kindliness
were urged upon the leaders.<a id="FNanchor_III-2" href="#Footnote_III-2" class="fnanchor">III-2</a></p>

<p>The belief in the future world claimed a lion’s
share of the attention of the Egyptian. As a result,
sculpture flourished. It was believed that if
the human figure was copied and the copy preserved,
the spirit and the body of the departed person
could be more easily re-united. Architecture
developed, but with the tombs or pyramids and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
other monuments as the chief forms. Urban mural
divisions and fortified walls are still to be found
as evidences of Egyptian social institutions.</p>

<p>It was taught that in the next world the individual
would be held accountable for his deeds in
this life. This belief acted as a powerful social
control; it involved specific social obligations. The
individual must deal openly with his fellowmen.
He must observe the rights of the weaker members
of society. For example, he must not make false
charges against a slave to the master of the slave.
He must show that he has respected the social
rights that were invested in property. From the
moral and social writings of the Egyptian scribes,
it is apparent that in religious matters, the individual
was moved to give thought to his duties as
a citizen and as a neighbor.</p>

<p>(2) The ancient Babylonian and Assyrian social
order was similar in many ways to Egyptian
civilization. The Babylonian description of a great
deluge resembles the account of the Flood that is
given in the Old Testament, and indicates thought
about morals and social life. Both Babylon and
Assyria developed a religion which was expressed
in terms of the nation-group. The boundaries of
one, with Merodach at the head, and of the other
with Assur in supreme control, marked the national
group divisions. Merodach, it was believed, accompanied
the king in the wars and fought for the
nation. He was concerned entirely, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
traditions, with the welfare of Babylonia as a population
group.</p>

<p>The attitude in Babylonian society toward the
institution of slavery was distinctly different from
that in Rome, but similar to the Egyptian practices.
The slave was considered in a more social way than
by the Romans. He was frequently regarded as
one of the family; he could even become a free
member of society. “Slavery was no bar to his
promotion.” Moreover, slavery did not necessarily
imprint a social stigma upon the slave.</p>

<p>The social rights of women were similar to the
Egyptian customs. The married woman of the
ruling classes possessed definite property rights.
She could use the property that she owned as she
saw fit; she could even bequeath it as she chose.
Her dowry gave her economic independence; it was
her absolute property, which she could bequeath by
will in any way that she desired.</p>

<p>The earliest well-known Babylonian ruler was
Hammurapi (2124–2081). He is known best
through his famous book of laws, the Code of
Hammurapi. The Code bespeaks for the author
the desire to rule Babylonian society justly. There
are minute regulations of private business and of
labor conditions which give the Code some of the
characteristics of modern mercantilistic thought.</p>

<p>The Code contains perhaps the earliest forms of
labor legislation that were enacted. Hammurapi
sought through legislation to determine wages for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
different classes of labor. The Code prescribed
severe punishment for anyone who sheltered a runaway
slave. In this and similar ways, property
rights were protected and human elements subordinated.
It was not until the Deuteronomic Code
was written that the rights of labor received legislative
recognition.</p>

<p>Hammurapi stood for a paternalistic control of
society. His idea of justice was literally that of
an eye for an eye. “If a man has caused the loss
of a patrician’s eye, his eye shall one cause to be
lost.”<a id="FNanchor_III-3" href="#Footnote_III-3" class="fnanchor">III-3</a> Justice, moreover, was subject to the law
of social gradation. An offense against a man of
lower rank might be atoned by paying money. “If
a man has caused a poor man to lose his eye, he
shall pay one mina of silver.”<a id="FNanchor_III-4" href="#Footnote_III-4" class="fnanchor">III-4</a> Additional light is
thrown on the concept of justice by other passages
from the Code, especially by this one: “If a builder
has built a house for a man and has not made strong
his work, and the house he has built has fallen,
and he has caused the death of the owner of the
house, that builder shall be put to death.”<a id="FNanchor_III-5" href="#Footnote_III-5" class="fnanchor">III-5</a></p>

<p>The intellectual progress and the inventions of
the Babylonians are indicative of social status. The
development along artistic lines, particularly in
architecture and sculpture, must have exerted an
indirect but important social influence. Significant
advances in surgery had been made preceding the
reign of Hammurapi. In medicine, however, the
demonic theory of the causes of disease enslaved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the people.</p>

<p>The Assyrians, who lived to the north of the
Babylonians, were less social in type. They were
little concerned about the future life; their religion
was relatively undeveloped. The Assyrian artists
gave their attention chiefly to the king, the court,
and to war. They reproduced in artistic form the
king and the soldier, but ignored the life and customs
of the people.</p>

<p>(3) When we turn to early East Indian records,
we find a higher development of social ideals
than among any peoples which have thus far been
considered. In the Vedic documents there is considerable
evidence of communal life and of a remarkable
degree of social spirit and brotherliness.
In the East Indian account of a Deluge—similar to
the Deluge that is described in Genesis—there is a
conception of punishment that falls upon the group
because of the sins of individuals. Sacrifice, among
the Vedic believers, had acquired a positive social
function. It was considered as a social act, in
which the worshipper and the god took part. The
food strengthened the god and the spiritual contact
strengthened the worshiper. Hence mutual sympathy
was generated.</p>

<p>With the rise of Brahmanism, the caste system
developed. It divided society. It gave structure
to the concept that some people are naturally—and
artificially—superior to other people. In the laws
of Manu, several social concepts are broached. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
nature of marriage and the duties of a householder
are explained. The duties of a woman are prescribed.
The nature of private and public law is
noteworthy, and the recognition of the obligation
of one caste to another in times of distress marks
the beginning of a reaction against the caste system.
It was considered possible for an individual
to fall from a caste to the one below, but not for
an individual to rise in caste. The moral standards
for individuals reached a level comparable to those
represented in certain of the teachings of Jesus.
For example, notice this instruction:</p>

<p>Let him patiently bear hard words, let him not
insult anybody, nor become anybody’s enemy for
the sake of this perishable body. Against an angry
man let him not in return show anger; let him bless
when he is cursed.</p>

<p>Buddhism inaugurated a set of social ideas which
involved the abolition of the caste system. In the
fourth of the “Four Noble Truths” the principles
which are formulated, are partly of social import.
Commendation is extended to right speech—speech
that is friendly, and sincere toward others. The requirements
include right conduct—conduct which
is peaceable and honorable toward other persons.
Stress is placed upon right means of securing livelihood—methods
which do not involve the injury or
the taking of life. There are types of modern business
enterprise that are extolled in our Christian
America which would fall under the ban of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
“Noble Truths” in pagan India.</p>

<p>Among the “ten commandments” of Buddha,
eight represent social ideas and obligations:</p>

<p>(1) Not to kill any living being.</p>

<p>(2) Not to take that which is not given (not to
steal).</p>

<p>(3) To refrain from adultery.</p>

<p>(4) To speak no untruth (not to lie to other
people).</p>

<p>(5) To abstain from intoxicating liquors.</p>

<p>(6) Not to slander.</p>

<p>(7) Not to covet.</p>

<p>(8) Not to be angry.</p>

<p>Buddha taught that hatred is to be repaid by
love, that life is to be filled with kindness and compassion,
that the widest toleration is to be practised.
The teachings of Buddha engendered a delicate
social consciousness regarding the relation of the
individual to his fellows. The precepts were strong
enough to break down rigid class barriers. The
underlying conception was broadly human.</p>

<p>Additional light is thrown on the social thought
of Buddha by the following sayings which are credited
to him:</p>

<p>Pity and sympathy is the Buddha’s mind.</p>

<p>Pity to his parents is the Supreme Law.</p>

<p>Honesty is the Paradise of the Bodhisattva.</p>

<p>O my Disciples, flee from fornication, know how
to be content with your own wife, and do not even
for a single moment lust after another woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>A state without a ruler is like a body without a
head; it cannot exist very long.</p>

<p>The king looks upon his subjects with a heart of
mercy, as if they were his children; and the people
regard the king as their father.</p>

<p>If there is no Buddha in the world, be good to
your parents; for to be good to one’s parents is to
minister unto Buddha.</p>

<p>Nursing a sick man is the great field where the
righteous tree of mind grows.</p>

<p>Even a strong man cannot lift himself.</p>

<p>Ten people have ten colors (opinions).</p>

<p>The paint which is painted by ten fingers (men)
is accurate. (In the multitude of counsellors there
is safety.)</p>

<p>The sayings of Buddha may be summed up in
the statement that, like many of the teachings of
Jesus, they accent the gentle virtues and the passive
traits of a people bearing a yoke against which they
are powerless to revolt, the virtues of obedience,
respect to those in authority, long-suffering, patience,
even resignation.</p>

<p>(4) The social thought of early China can best
be gleaned from the writings of Confucius. This
scholar was not a reformer or a religious leader,
but primarily a conserver. He was interested in
civil and political affairs. His books reflect not his
own ideas, for his originality was not great, but
the concepts which had been worked out before his
time. In the <i>Li Ki</i>, or Record of Rites, there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
many social and domestic precepts. In a way the
<i>Li Ki</i>, “the Chinamen’s manual of conduct,” is a
treatise on social as well as individual ethics.
Around the family group, Chinese social ideas revolved.
On the death of his mother, Confucius,
for example, went into seclusion for twenty-seven
months. On sacrificial occasions the living members
and the departed spirits of the household were
accustomed to gather in one filial communal group.
The welfare of the individual was completely subordinated
to the interests of the family group of
spirits.</p>

<p>The Chinese worship, or honor, their ancestors.
The worship of the past has paralyzed new thought.
Custom imitation has ruled and tradition has been
reverenced.</p>

<p>Marriage receives special attention, but the arrangements
are made by parents or “go-betweens.”
Socially, the sexes do not intermingle. The parents
exercise complete control over the children;
the mother bears a considerable portion of the burdens
of parental discipline. Filial piety is the cardinal
virtue. Although polygamy is discountenanced,
concubinage is permitted. The sexes dress
very much alike, except in headdress and footgear.
The style of wearing apparel is not only simple and
aesthetic, but it “minimizes the visible distinctions
of sex.”</p>

<p>Confucius, or Kung-fu-tsze, believed in the efficacy
of setting good examples. Imitation would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
then accomplish the desired results. By these methods,
Confucius expected that society would be improved.
Fundamental principles of a stable social
order, more than of social progress, were in the
mind of Confucius. He conceived of the universe
as a perfect order. Likewise, he thought of the
state as a perfect social order. Confucius urged
that the individual strive for perfection. According
to the Confucian doctrine of the Superior Man,
the individual should master his own passions and
desires, substituting an enjoyment of music, ceremony,
and of friendship, for the enjoyment that
comes from the exercise of the bodily passions.
He should seek salvation through the study of
nature and of things. Moral character and intelligence
if accompanied by bravery will produce the
highest type of personality.</p>

<p>In Chinese social thought the family and state
were early recognized as the two leading institutions
in society. In the civil organization it is
worth while to note the <em>hien</em>, or city district. The
<em>hien</em> has been pronounced “the real unit of Chinese
corporate life”; and the <em>hien</em> magistrate, “the heart
and soul of all official life.” Since this magistrate
keeps closely in touch with the masses, he is called
by the people “the father and mother officer.” The
<em>hien</em> contains some of the germ ideas of democracy;
it emphasizes local self-government.</p>

<p>The ancient laws were elaborate, giving an unusual
degree of power to the judges. Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
customs ruled, the judges often possessed a liberal
margin of freedom in determining the nature of
punishments. Contrary to Western procedure, the
Chinese consider an accused man as guilty until
proved otherwise. Excessive corporate punishment
is deplored.<a id="FNanchor_III-6" href="#Footnote_III-6" class="fnanchor">III-6</a> Confucius objected to the maintenance
of a government by the use of fear and of
coercive measures. He predicted that capital punishment
(even in a land ruled by custom) would be
abolished in a hundred years.</p>

<p>The ideas of peace and harmonious social relationships
have long held sway in China. Militarism
has been scorned, and war held in contempt. It is
ironical that as China begins to function as a world
power in contact with Western and Christian nations,
she is compelled to find her chief defense in
an uncivilized and unChristian militarism.</p>

<p>Sympathy is a fundamental concept among the
Chinese. Unfortunately, it has been instrumental
in producing a highly specialized and professionalized
class of beggars. Industry and patience are
characteristic social virtues. Lao-tse, the founder
of Taoism and a contemporary of Confucius,
taught the social precept: Recompense injury with
kindness. Confucius, who disagreed, taught that
kindness should be paid with kindness, and injury
with injury. This conception led Confucius
to formulate his golden rule of human conduct:
Do not do to others what you would not have others
do to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>Obedience to authority has been for centuries a
cardinal social principle of the Chinese. It was
enunciated by Confucius, who spoke as a representative
of the ruling classes. In stressing obedience
to temporal authorities and in shunning the
gods, Confucius has been accused of fostering a
materialistic philosophy. This charge is partly offset
by his ethical teachings. Confucius was a humanitarian
rather than a materialist; he was a
utilitarian rather than an idealist. In these attitudes
he reflects not his own opinions so much as the
thought of the generations which preceded him.</p>

<p>Mencius, who lived shortly after Confucius, was
an environmentalist in the sense that he believed
that external evil influences have corrupted man’s
original good nature. On the other hand, Mencius
urged progress through regeneration of the heart.
Mencius was a more thoroughgoing humanist than
Confucius, for he made the happiness of the people
the supreme goal for the individual. He condemned
war and warriors alike and declared that
generals are criminals. He asserted that it is
wrong to conquer a territory against the will of the
people of that territory.</p>

<p>Additional sidelights upon early Chinese social
thought are afforded by the following social proverbs
of ancient Chinese origin:</p>

<p>If a cat cries after eating the mouse, this is false
sympathy.</p>

<p>Follow good, learn good; follow beggar, learn to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
beg.</p>

<p>Gentlemen use heart; lesser men use strength.</p>

<p>New clothes but old friends are good.</p>

<p>Within the four seas all are brothers.</p>

<p>If two people were 1000 miles apart and be like-minded,
they will come together; if they sit opposite
one another and are not like-minded there will be
no mutual acquaintance.</p>

<p>Speak language fitting to station of man you
meet.</p>

<p>All under heaven is one home.</p>

<p>Although a man is away from home, his heart is
there.</p>

<p>The big fish eat the little ones, the little ones eat
the shrimps, and the shrimps are forced to eat mud
(applied to the classes of society who pay taxes).</p>

<p>He who praises me on all occasions is a fool who
despises me or a knave who wishes to cheat me.</p>

<p>Govern thyself, and you will be able to govern
the world.</p>

<p>The hearts of the people are the only legitimate
foundations of an empire.</p>

<p>By nature all men are alike; but by education,
widely different.</p>

<p>For the sake of one good action, a hundred evil
ones should be forgotten.</p>

<p>To forget one’s ancestors is to be a brook without
a source, a tree without a root.</p>

<p>Rogues differ little; each began first as a disobedient
son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>Of all man’s actions, there is none greater than
filial piety.</p>

<p>When they saw an old man, people walking or
driving gave him the road. Men who had white
hairs mingling with the black did not carry burdens
along the highways (care for the aged).</p>

<p>When the man of high station is well instructed,
he loves men; when the man of low station is well
instructed, he is easily ruled.</p>

<p>Three friendships are advantageous: friendship
with the upright, friendship with the sincere, and
friendship with the man of observation. Three are
injurious: friendship with a man of spurious airs,
friendship with the insinuatingly soft, and friendship
with the glib-tongued.</p>

<p>Who taught you politeness? The impolite.</p>

<p>To be a successful monarch, one must be a just
monarch.</p>

<p>Of the different peoples which have thus far been
considered, the Chinese have furnished the most
elaborate degree of social thought. While the social
ideals of the Chinese are largely unsystematic,
they accent the family and the state as essential
social institutions. They also reveal even a significant
conception of world brotherliness. The
Chinese have probably created more social proverbs
than any other people, past or present. For the
stage of civilization that is represented by proverbs
and sayings, the social thought of the Chinese is
unsurpassed. In this regard the Chinese have but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
one close competitor, the ancient Hebrews.</p>

<p>(5) The Persians, who after their defeat by
Alexander the Great in 331 B. C. have been credited
with having turned over the torch of civilization
to the Greeks, made a contribution to social
thought similar to that of the other ancient peoples.
Under Cyrus the Great, Darius, and Xerxes a system
of state education was fostered which was designed
chiefly to train soldiers. It did not stress
social and intellectual development, although it existed
in a land that produced the Magi. The individuals
who were not in the army received slight
educational benefits.</p>

<p>It is in the teachings of Zoroaster of the sixteenth
century B. C. that we first find the main
trend of Persian social thought. The Zend Avesta,
the document from which Zoroasterism and the
modern Parsee religion have evolved, emphasizes
the principle of kindliness in all important human
relationships. Sanitation, business honesty, and
chastity in family relationships are taught.</p>

<p>The ancient Hebrews and the Greeks each made
such large contributions to social thought that separate
chapters will be devoted to these peoples. In
a summary of the social thought of the Egyptians,
Babylonians and Assyrians, East Indians, Chinese,
and Persians, it may be said that there is a rather
uniform emphasis upon the elemental virtues, particularly
upon kindliness. While the individual’s
salvation is given prominence, the individual is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
urged to be socially considerate and to cultivate
sympathetic relationships with the gods and with
his fellow human beings.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Social Thought of the Hebrews</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ancient Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian,
East Indian, Chinese, and Persian records disclose
a set of elemental and yet more or less passive social
backgrounds against which the social ideals of
the Hebrew prophets shine forth like stars of the
first magnitude. The Pentateuch and the writings
of the Hebrew wise men are rich in gleams of a
social spirit, while the Hebrew prophets, notably,
Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, uttered flaming
indictments of social evils.</p>

<p>The Hebrews stood head and shoulders above
their contemporaries in social thinking. They left
a series of historical documents, covering several
centuries and revealing a specific evolution in social
concepts. They expressed the fundamentals from
which Christian social thought developed, and from
which much of the ethical and social thinking
of Western civilization on its practical side has
evolved.</p>

<p>The social thought of the Hebrews was born of
group suffering. Through the mists of the earliest
Hebrew traditions we discern that conflicts occurred
in the Euphrates Valley which sent Abraham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
out on his perilous journey toward unknown
and hostile Canaan. The gaunt spectre, famine,
brought distress to the household of the domestic-loving
Abraham and drove him to Egypt where he
sojourned for a time. Abram, exalted father, or
Abraham, father of a multude, became the founder
in a sense of three world religions, for to him
Judaism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism trace
their origins.</p>

<p>Throughout the years of migration, exile, and
suffering, Abraham maintained his religious faith
and belief. By means of his simple religion he was
able to interpret sanely the troubles and conflicts of
life. Out of suffering interpreted religiously,
Abraham developed a remarkably well-balanced and
social personality. From this beginning, Hebrew
social thought evolved. Ultimately, Israel created
social concepts which has won for her the distinction
of being “the leading social teacher of the
human race.”<a id="FNanchor_IV-1" href="#Footnote_IV-1" class="fnanchor">IV-1</a></p>

<p>As a social entity the Hebrews were the result of
“a titanic social struggle;” they arose out of an industrial
crisis. The scene was laid in Egypt. The
descendants of Jacob were working long hours with
little pay, as slaves, and under harsh social conditions.
One of their number, more favored than the
rest by heredity and environment, saw a Hebrew
workman being beaten by an Egyptian “boss.” The
favored one, Moses, felt the surging passions of
social injustice rising within his breast—and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
slew the boss. Moses thereby became the founder
of the world’s labor movement. By an act of violence
in the impassioned days of youth, Moses became
“a social agitator”; by years of patient service
of his people in the name of Jehovoh, he became
one of the world’s greatest social seers.</p>

<p>Rameses II was “an unprincipled captain of industry.”
He was haughty, hard-hearted, and without
social conscience. Moses was sympathetic,
socially sensitive, and keenly religious. Rameses II
was a leading representative of an ancient aristocracy;
Moses was the first great exponent of an incipient
democracy, and “the first man in history
with a well-developed social consciousness.”</p>

<p>According to the Exodus record Moses, as the
murderer of an Egyptian boss, felt no qualms of
conscience, but he did fear the mighty Pharaoh. At
that time in history it was a minor matter to kill
a slave; but to have killed a boss was vastly different.
The slave represented weakness; the boss was
the official representative of political and financial
power. Consequently, Moses fled the country. In
Egypt he was helpless, and in danger of losing his
life. He fled to Midian.</p>

<p>In Midian, Moses pondered over the economic
and social injustices to which his people were being
subjected. He communed with God, from whom he
received the motive power to correct a gigantic
social wrong. His vision of Jehovah gave him the
conviction that Jehovah is a God of justice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
mercy who understands social and industrial evils
and sympathizes with the socially defeated classes.
Moses reports this remarkable social message from
Jehovah:</p>

<p>“I have surely seen the affliction of my people
that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry of
anguish because of their taskmasters, for I know
their sorrows, and I am come down to deliver them
out of the power of the Egyptians.”<a id="FNanchor_IV-2" href="#Footnote_IV-2" class="fnanchor">IV-2</a></p>

<p>In other words, against the union of great wealth
and political power in the hands of an unjust man,
God revolted, and God said to Moses: “Rescue this
Israelitish people from the heels of autocracy.”
Moses conceived of Jehovah as a God who is “full
of sympathy for the afflicted and dependent and
ever eager to champion their cause against cruel
oppression.” Moses’ conception of Jehovah as a
socially spirited God is unique for that day in
human history. God is described as a lover of
justice and even a lover of mankind. When God
speaks, it is usually in terms of democracy. The
first social teachings of the Old Testament, considered
chronologically, are those against social and
industrial oppression.</p>

<p>A momentous conflict ensued. Fired by the
promises and presence and power of Jehovah,
Moses journeyed back to Egypt. He proceeded to
organize the first labor strike known to mankind.
Thereupon, the angry Pharaoh commanded the
workers to make brick without straw. And when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the workers cried out against the impositions and
burdens, the agents of “the first great captains of
industry” taunted the workers and cried at them:
“Ye are idle, ye are idle.” But God and Moses won
against the hosts of autocracy and plutocracy. The
workers were freed.</p>

<p>Out of these struggles the Hebrew nation took
form. Group loyalty, or patriotism, became a conscious
Hebrew concept. The idea of kinship was
supplemented by an appreciation of the meaning of
national life. Furthermore, a sense of social and
economic justice received a clear-cut and positive
human expression and divine approval. For the
first time the social problem was defined.</p>

<p>The major social chord which the Hebrew
prophets kept vibrating was justice. Some of the
recurring interpretations of the needs of the hour
were: Let justice roll down like waters; Rulers
shall govern in justice; Hear, I pray you, ye heads
of Israel, is it not for you to know justice?</p>

<p>The Hebrew word for the English “justice” is
<em>mishpat</em>. It is used in various senses, such as,
justice, order, law, right, legal right. Amos wanted
<em>mishpat</em> established in the land. Micah asserted
that Jehovah requires the individual to do <em>mishpat</em>,
and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with his
God. Isaiah urged the people to do well and to seek
<em>mishpat</em>; he pronounced woe upon those who turned
aside the needy from <em>mishpat</em>; he declared Jehovah
to be a God of <em>mishpat</em>. Jeremiah made plain that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Jehovah exercises mercy and <em>mishpat</em> among the
people.</p>

<p>Amos protested vigorously against special class
privileges. He denounced the wealthy classes because
of their social arrogance and economic injustice.
In describing them, he points out a fundamental
principle of social procedure. By their repression
of those who are protesting, they “are
heaping up violence”; that is, autocratic repression
will never right injustice, but will foster ultimate
revolution. Amos charged the rulers and all persons
in positions of social power with the primary
obligation of seeing that the poor and the outcast
are protected from exploitation. What satire in a
day when rulers were noted for their exploitation
of the weak social classes!</p>

<p>A special responsibility rests upon judges. Amos
severely arraigned all who turn judgment to wormwood
and cast righteousness to the ground. Anathemas
were heaped upon the takers of bribes, especially
if they sit in places of public authority and
wear the robes of law and patriotism. Hot denunciation
fell also upon the private doer of injustice;
upon the merchant who makes smaller the measure
and perverts the false balances; upon all who trample
in any way upon the needy, who trample on the
head of the poor, who sell the righteous for silver,
who turn aside the way of the humble.<a id="FNanchor_IV-3" href="#Footnote_IV-3" class="fnanchor">IV-3</a> The concept
of justice was vividly defined by Amos. Moreover,
the shepherd prophet of Tekoa had the courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and ability to make the concept clear to all who
would listen to him. Amos spoke for justice on
the throne, on the judge’s bench, in the activities of
the wealthy, in the transactions of merchants, and
in the daily dealings of individuals with one another.</p>

<p>The campaign against injustice is carried forward
by the first Isaiah, the statesman and orator.
In the Kingdom of Judah, Isaiah found the same
social evils that Amos had earlier preached against
in the Northern kingdom. The boldness of his
attack is startling:</p>

<p>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of
thieves: everyone loveth gifts, and followeth after
rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does
the cause of the widow come unto them.<a id="FNanchor_IV-4" href="#Footnote_IV-4" class="fnanchor">IV-4</a></p>

<p>Then Isaiah enters upon perhaps the most open,
daring, and indignant challenge to doers of social
iniquity that is to be found anywhere:</p>

<p>Ye have eaten of the vineyard; the spoil of the
poor is in your houses. What mean ye that ye beat
my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the
poor?<a id="FNanchor_IV-5" href="#Footnote_IV-5" class="fnanchor">IV-5</a></p>

<p>After the manner of Amos, Isaiah protested vigorously
against the judges and officers of the law
who for a bribe vindicate the wicked and deprive
the innocent man of his innocence. He denounced
in no doubtful language the scribes who devote
themselves to writing oppression, who turn aside
the dependent from securing justice, who prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Jehovah’s followers from receiving honest treatment,
who prey upon widows and despoil orphans.
Special condemnation was heaped upon those who
set up iniquitous decrees.</p>

<p>Isaiah was a forerunner in an indirect sense of
Henry George, for he vehemently rebuked land
monopolists. His new principle is contained in a
pronouncement of woes upon the persons who join
house to house and add field to field, until there is
no land left except for the monopolist who dwells
as a lord over all. Isaiah protested against social
injustice not only because of the harmful effects
upon the individual but also because of the destructive
and enervating national results.</p>

<p>After the fashion of Amos and Isaiah, Micah
conceived of Jehovah as a just God. Micah depicts
the social injustice of his day in terms of the
persons who hate the good and love the evil, who
pluck off the skin of the weak, even the flesh from
the bones of Jehovah’s followers; “who also eat the
flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off
them; and they break their bones, and chop them
in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the
caldron.”<a id="FNanchor_IV-6" href="#Footnote_IV-6" class="fnanchor">IV-6</a></p>

<p>Micah unhesitatingly condemns the priests who
are giving oracles for a reward, and the prophets
who are divining for silver and who are trusting
in Jehovah to protect them. Micah was perhaps
the first person to describe the activities of the
criminaloid which have been so carefully analyzed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
by Professor E. A. Ross. He grasped the concept
of the social sinner who keeps within the law. He
attacked wealthy landowners who crush the small
holders; he spared neither high officials, nor priests.
He presented his social concepts with precision and
effectiveness.</p>

<p>The invectives against social injustice are carried
into the teachings of Jeremiah. They appear later
in the Deuteronomic Code. The Psalmists deprecated
injustice. The wisdom teachers uttered profound
warnings on the subject. The writer of Job
deplored injustice. Throughout the Old Testament
the almost countless references justify the conclusion
that justice is the leading social concept which
is presented by ancient Hebrew thought.</p>

<p>The Old Testament parallels its denunciation of
unjust social relationships with diatribes against
luxury. The evil effects of great riches are again
and again described. Amos boldly pointed the
finger of scorn at the idle rich, at those who “lie
upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon
their couches.”</p>

<p>The possession of vast wealth has usually been
considered by those persons who are immediately
concerned as an expression of divine favor. Amos
exposed the fallacies in this belief, commanded the
owners of wealth to assume social responsibility,
and instantly to cease their unholy practices of securing
gain.</p>

<p>Isaiah united with Amos in treating the possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of wealth not as a matter of favor or luck,
but as a social trust. With one stroke Jeremiah
tore off the gilded frame from about the life of
the self-indulgent, luxury-loving King Jehoiakim.
What powerful and autocratic monarch was ever
charged with indulging in luxury in such relentless
and uncompromising language as this?</p>

<p>Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
and his chambers by injustice....</p>

<p>Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself
in cedar?...</p>

<p>But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy
covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and
for oppression, and for violence, to do it.</p>

<p>The ways of the dishonest rich are vividly described
by Jeremiah. They set snares and catch
people with lying. Their houses are full of evidences
of their crooked dealings. They maintain
themselves in luxury despite wanton expenditures
by violating the needs of the fatherless and the
needy.</p>

<p>Zephaniah was no less direct in pointing out the
dangers in wealth. He declared that ill-gotten gains
shall themselves become a prey and that the houses
of the sinful rich shall become desolate. All their
silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver
them from their ultimate desolation.</p>

<p>In a beautiful and effective style the Wisdom
writer in Proverbs unconsciously sums up the Old
Testament philosophy concerning wealth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>Labor not to become rich; cease from thine own
wisdom. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which
is not? For riches certainly make themselves
wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>

<p>The Old Testament with surprising uniformity
supports the cause of labor. The welfare of the
slave is frequently espoused. According to the
Deuteronomic Code a runaway slave who was
caught did not necessarily need to be returned to
his owner. In fact, a person who harbored such
a slave was expressly enjoined not to return him.
By this injunction the rights of property and vested
interests in slaves were ignored. Such an attitude
was in opposition to the Code of Hammurapi and
to the codes of vested interests throughout history.
Slavery, however, was a well-established institution
among the ancient Hebrews.<a id="FNanchor_IV-8" href="#Footnote_IV-8" class="fnanchor">IV-8</a></p>

<p>Although the law book of Hammurapi fixed the
wages of laborers, the Old Testament law book restricted
the hours of labor. Not only is the master
to limit his labor to six days a week, but he is commanded
to see that his slaves, male and female, do
not work more than six days. Modern industry,
even twentieth century manufacturing enterprise
in the United States, has been persistently violating
the labor rules of the Hebrew law-givers. Employers
are commanded not to take advantage of poor
and needy hired servants. They shall not oppress
labor simply because they are powerful and labor
is weak. Even the poor immigrant laborer is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
to be exploited!</p>

<p>The first legislation in behalf of immigrants is
found in Deuteronomy. Employers must respect
the needs of alien workers. The foreigner shall not
be oppressed. In the ordinary dealings between
citizens and foreigners, justice must not be perverted.
The Hebrew law makers even went so far
as to issue the command: Love ye therefore the
strangers, for ye were strangers in the land of
Egypt.</p>

<p>The institution of marriage is early accented in
the Old Testament. In the second chapter of Genesis
divine approval is placed upon marriage. In
accordance with biological and social needs the institution
of marriage is made sacred. Although
the Hebrews are noted for their emphasis upon the
responsibility of children to parents, the husband is
ordered to forsake his father and his mother and
cleave unto his wife. A man’s obligation to his
helpmate exceeds even his obligations to his father
and mother.</p>

<p>The concept of a long-suffering, patient husband
is extensively elaborated in the teachings of Hosea.
This prophet of the eighth century, B. C., demonstrated
the sanctity of the marriage relation by remaining
true to it even after his wife bore children
of whom he was not the father. It is remarkable
that Hosea should not have divorced his wife at
once when he learned of her unfaithfulness to the
marriage vow. Hosea taught, by example, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
divorce should be the last resort after all the means
of love have been used in trying to win back the
erring partner.</p>

<p>The description of Hosea’s domestic difficulties,
whether allegorical or not, is an early protest
against the double standard of morals for man and
woman. The attitude of people in modern society
who blame and shun the fallen woman but permit
the guilty man to continue to enjoy the company of
respectable men and women is vigorously challenged
by Hosea.</p>

<p>The last word against sex immorality was pronounced
by Hosea. His description of the effects
of widespread sex immorality is brief but incisive.</p>

<p>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away
the heart.</p>

<p>Their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the
birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</p>

<p>Their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit.</p>

<p>In the Deuteronomic laws we find the duties of
parents to children and of children to parents carefully
outlined. Parents, primarily, are made responsible
for moral and religious education in the
home; and children are under obligations to obey
their parents. This teaching is summed up in the
injunction:<a id="FNanchor_IV-10" href="#Footnote_IV-10" class="fnanchor">IV-10</a> Honor thy father and thy mother,
that thy days may be long upon the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee; and in the imprecation:
Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
shall be put out in obscure darkness.<a id="FNanchor_IV-11" href="#Footnote_IV-11" class="fnanchor">IV-11</a></p>

<p>The Wisdom writers dwell at considerable length
upon the proper relationships of husbands and
wives and of parents and children. They point the
finger of shame at the quarrelsome woman. They
warn against the woman whose chief asset is her
beauty. A virtuous wife is a crown to her husband,
but an immoral wife is as rottenness in his
bones.<a id="FNanchor_IV-12" href="#Footnote_IV-12" class="fnanchor">IV-12</a></p>

<p>The Wisdom teachers do not minimize the importance
of parental discipline. On occasion parents
must act with force. Correction of children
is commanded. The situation is pictured in the following
language:<a id="FNanchor_IV-13" href="#Footnote_IV-13" class="fnanchor">IV-13</a></p>

<p>The word and reproof give wisdom; but a child
left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.</p>

<p>In other words, it is necessary that parents assume
a positive, definite attitude in regard to child
nurture. They must see that their children are
actually trained in the ways in which they should
go. Even the loving parent must sometimes show
his affection for his child by chastising the child.
Only by such a procedure do children grow up to
be a comfort to parents in their old age.</p>

<p>On the other hand the child must assume his
share of responsibility. It is the part of wisdom
for children to receive willingly the instruction that
parents can give. The wise son loves parental advice.
He listens gladly to his father; he does not
despise his mother’s counsels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>It has already been intimated that the Old Testament
writers frequently stress the importance of
high standards of conduct for women. Amos rebuked
the wives of nobles and the wealthy who
fritter away their best impulses in idleness and
sinful living and who dissipate their deepest instincts
in debauchery. Amos and Isaiah agreed, apparently,
that a nation’s welfare depends on the
attitudes of its women. The wrath of God will fall
upon women who are haughty, who walk with heads
held high and with wanton glances, who go tripping
along, “making a tinkling with their feet.”</p>

<p>The anti-social character of sin was pointed out
in Genesis. Cain was the first to raise naïvely and
blandly the question: Am I my brother’s keeper?
Sinful living narrows the soul, increases selfishness,
and vitiates a genuine social attitude. Sinning is
repudiating social responsibility. Amos advanced
the idea that selfish living was nothing less than disloyalty
to one’s country. To dissipate one’s energy
is to undermine one’s usefulness to his country.</p>

<p>Intemperance was deplored. Isaiah has been
called the first temperance reformer of the world.
His impassioned and classic utterances are well represented
by the following lines:<a id="FNanchor_IV-14" href="#Footnote_IV-14" class="fnanchor">IV-14</a></p>

<p>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning
that they may follow strong drink; that continue
until night, till wine inflame them.</p>

<p>Isaiah warned especially the priests and prophets
of the evils of intemperance. Wine will swallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
them up, it will put them out of the way, it will
cause them to err in wisdom and to stumble in judgment.</p>

<p>In both Leviticus and Numbers the danger that
lurks in the wine cup is recognized. The special
servants of Jehovah are commanded to separate
themselves from wine and strong drink. In Proverbs
the Wisdom writer declares:<a id="FNanchor_IV-15" href="#Footnote_IV-15" class="fnanchor">IV-15</a> Wine is a
mocker, strong drink is raging and whoever is
deceived thereby is not wise. The same authority
admonishes rulers and judges not to drink wine
lest they forget the law and pervert the judgment
of the afflicted. On the other hand, a reversion to
a lower standard is made in Proverbs when the
legitimacy of giving strong drink to the poor and
miserable is recognized, so that they may forget
their poverty and misery.<a id="FNanchor_IV-16" href="#Footnote_IV-16" class="fnanchor">IV-16</a> The general teaching,
however, is that strong drink leads to social inefficiency
and the disintegration of human personalities.</p>

<p>The cities of refuge represent a new social idea.
A person who has taken life without intention may
flee to and find protection in the cities of refuge.
The altar and the sanctuary are designated as places
to which persons may flee who are not wilful murderers.<a id="FNanchor_IV-17" href="#Footnote_IV-17" class="fnanchor">IV-17</a></p>

<p>The social concept of democracy occupies an interesting
place in the Old Testament literature. In
the days of Abraham the kinship group prevailed.
Within this group there were many households,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
ruled by patriarchs. Within the kinship groups
high standards of honor were maintained, but anti-social
attitudes toward outside and foreign groups
were encouraged. It was justifiable, for example,
to lie to foreign groups and even to kill the representatives
of such peoples.</p>

<p>The concept of democracy developed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari passu</i>
with the evolution of the idea of Jehovah. In the
minds of the Hebrews, Jehovah, or Jahweh, was
first a tribal god, then a national god; and finally,
a universal God, that is, a being who is interested
in the welfare of all peoples, and not simply in the
welfare of “the chosen people.”</p>

<p>The Hebrew conception of the state contained
several democratic elements. The fundamental
purpose of the state was declared to be the welfare
not of an irresponsible monarch, but of the people
themselves. This idea stands out in marked contradiction
to the practices of the Canaanites, who
submitted themselves helplessly to capricious and
autocratic rulers.</p>

<p>The Hebrews treated the state as a part of a theocracy.
But when Jehovah spoke, he usually arraigned
false wealth, arbitrary political power,
selfish ambition of kings, luxurious living, and special
privileges. Jehovah spoke for the oppressed,
the poor, the defeated, the laborer,<a id="FNanchor_IV-8a" href="#missing" class="fnanchor">IV-8</a> in short, for
humanity.</p>

<p>Consequently, loyalty to the nation was positive
and persistent. Consider this statement from Psalm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
137 of Hebrew patriotism on the part of exiled
Hebrews who longed for their native land:</p>

<p>By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea,
we wept, when we remembered Zion.</p>

<p>We hanged our harps upon the willows in the
midst thereof....</p>

<p>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
forget her cunning.</p>

<p>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave
to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem
above my chief joy.</p>

<p>According to Hosea, Jehovah charged the citizens
of the land to deal with one another on the
basis of fidelity and true love, and to stamp out all
social evils, such as perjury, stealing, committing
adultery, and mob violence. The writer of the Book
of Job portrayed a good citizen as one who delivers
the poor, who helps those about to perish, who
causes the widow’s heart to sing for joy.<a id="FNanchor_IV-18" href="#Footnote_IV-18" class="fnanchor">IV-18</a> He is
eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a father to
the needy. He searches out the cause of social
evils. Moreover, he breaks the jaws of the unrighteous,
and plucks the prey from their mouths.
He defends the blameless. He does not put his
confidence in gold or rejoice at his enemies when
evils beset them or they are destroyed. It may be
truly said that fundamental ideas of democracy
were originated by the Hebrews.</p>

<p>Amos raised the question of internationalism.
For the first time in history, the idea of a universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
God was postulated. Amos pronounced Jehovah
the God of other peoples besides the Israelites.
“Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of
Egypt?” said Jehovah, “and the Philistines from
Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?”<a id="FNanchor_IV-19" href="#Footnote_IV-19" class="fnanchor">IV-19</a> The day
would come, according to Isaiah and Micah, when
Jehovah would judge over many peoples and rebuke
strong nations. The conception of Jehovah as a
Being who transcends both time and space gave to
the Hebrew mind at its best a broader cast and a
more universal comprehension than the peoples of
contemporary tribes and nations possessed.</p>

<p>The concept of universal peace was invented by
the Hebrews. Isaiah and Micah share the honor
of being the first persons to advocate world peace,
and to predict the day when all nations shall worship
a just God and thereby be enabled to beat their
swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning-hooks,
when nation shall not stand against nation,
and when the methods of warfare shall no
longer be taught. The spirit of hatred and of
blind, selfish antagonism shall pass away. No modern
writer has ever spoken the doom of militarism
so trenchantly as the Old Testament prophet,
Isaiah, who said, according to the translation by
Charles Foster Kent:<a id="FNanchor_IV-20" href="#Footnote_IV-20" class="fnanchor">IV-20</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For every boot of the warrior with noisy tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every war-cloak drenched in the blood of the slain,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>
<p>The Hebrews strongly emphasized laws as a social
dynamic. Love will make socialized individuals.
It will demonstrate to a person his responsibilities
as a member of society and his duties to his fellow
human beings. It will stifle hatred. It will even
return good for evil. It is the cardinal virtue and
an eternal principle of right living.</p>

<p>The Old Testament teaches social salvation. Jehovah
is fundamentally interested in the improvement
of social and living conditions. He commanded
the socialization of all human relationships.
His teachings, as given by the prophets and Wisdom
writers, take cognizance of the influence of environment
upon character.</p>

<p>Hebrew social thought deals largely with social
injustice. Social evils are vividly described and
evil-doers, chiefly kings and judges, are vigorously
and fearlessly arraigned. The family is made the
chief social institution, and love is crowned servant
of all. Education is centered in the home, and moral
discipline is made the keynote of education; hence
the Hebrews survived the Greeks and Romans. A
new and perfect social order, directed by a just Jehovah,
and motivated throughout all its individual
and social relationships by love, is prophesied.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Plato and Grecian Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In turning to a study of Grecian civilization we
find a development of social thought which on the
rational side excels in many particulars the social
thinking of the Hebrews, but which in its affective
elements falls far below the quality of Hebrew social
thought. We may expect to find, therefore, in
Grecian social thought important new contributions
which are complementary to the legacies from the
Hebrews, and which when taken in conjunction
with the early Christian forms of Hebrew social
thought constitute the main foundations of modern
social thought.</p>

<p>The thought life of the Greeks reached the crescendo
in the idealism of Plato (427–347 B. C.) and
the opportunism of Aristotle (384–322 B. C.). In
an idea-world Plato depicted an ideal society. After
studying 158 constitutions, Aristotle formulated
rules of practical social procedure. Plato’s <i>Republic</i>
and Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i> are the two leading
source books of Grecian social thought.</p>

<p>Plato and Aristotle were the first two thinkers
in history who left definitely organized analyses of
societary life. Although in point of time they stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
close together, in content of social reasoning they
are at many places antagonistic. However, their
high rank as thinkers need not blind anyone to the
fact that their social thought was in part an outgrowth
of theories held by predecessors. Antecedent
to Plato was Socrates and the Sophists; antecedent
to these scholars was a large number of
thinkers who, incidentally to their main intellectual
efforts, gave expression to isolated but significant
social ideas.</p>

<p>As early as the ninth century, B. C., Lycurgus declared
that the state owned the child, and urged a
system of education which would prepare the child
for the state. Despite, however, of a similar emphasis
by many later Greek leaders, “Hellas” never
developed a genuine national unity. She experienced
a temporary national patriotism only when
attacked by the Persians and at the seasons when
the national games were at their height.</p>

<p>It was Hesiod, the founder of Greek didactic
poetry, who about 700 B. C. described the Golden
Age and the subsequent ages of society. Hesiod
protested mildly against the social injustice in his
time.<a id="FNanchor_V-1" href="#Footnote_V-1" class="fnanchor">V-1</a> In the following century, Anaximander, the
philosopher, and Theognis, the elegiac poet,<a id="FNanchor_V-2" href="#Footnote_V-2" class="fnanchor">V-2</a> discussed
the value to society of providing that children
should be well born and well trained—the
fundamental concepts of current eugenics and euthenics.</p>

<p>Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, about 590 B. C.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
began to put into legislative practice certain ideas of
social reform, thereby preventing revolution. At
that time it was customary to sell persons into
slavery who could not pay their debts—a procedure
which Solon ended. The cost of living was very
high, consequently Solon forbade the export of food
products and thereby reduced prices for the consumer.
He introduced a measure which today
would be considered revolutionary, namely, the
limiting of the amount of land which an individual
might hold. For the classification of people on the
basis of wealth, he substituted a classification on
the basis of income. He lessened the severity of the
laws of Draco, and in other ways increased the
freedom of the individual. Although Solon’s régime
was followed by a tyranny, Solon is credited with
initiating certain essential ideas of democracy.</p>

<p>After the Tyrants, Athens under the leadership
of men like Cleisthenes became “a pure democracy.”
Cleisthenes democratized the Athenian Constitution.
For the four phylae he substituted ten phylae,
or units of government, thus securing a new and
better distribution of authority. He is credited with
introducing ostracism as a mode of punishment; he,
it is alleged, was the first individual to be ostracised
by his government.</p>

<p>The fifth century precursors of Plato and Aristotle
were numerous. Aeschylus (525–456 B. C.),
the first of the famous Athenian tragic poets, described
in general terms the evolution of civilized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
society.<a id="FNanchor_V-3" href="#Footnote_V-3" class="fnanchor">V-3</a> The artistic historian, Herodotus, developed
through his imagination a world point of view.
From an almost unlimited store of legendary and
ethnological materials, he elaborated a planetary
theme which had its beginning in the Trojan War
and its culmination in the conflict between Eastern
and Western civilizations. The basic social principle
in the writings of Herodotus is that downfall
awaits the insolent autocrats of earth. Herodotus
describes the customs and habits of the peoples<a id="FNanchor_V-4" href="#Footnote_V-4" class="fnanchor">V-4</a>
whom he visited on his numerous foreign travels in
such a detailed and elaborate fashion that he has
been styled the world’s first descriptive sociologist.</p>

<p>Pericles (495?-429 B. C.), perhaps the greatest
statesman of Greece, furthered the cause of democracy.
His conception of democracy led him to make
the entire body of citizens eligible to office-holding.
Pericles initiated a social program which in certain
aspects was paternalistic. He instituted the
plan of granting allowances for performing public
duties. As a result, unselfish public service was
minimized and political morale was weakened.
Pericles was led into this error<a id="FNanchor_V-5" href="#Footnote_V-5" class="fnanchor">V-5</a> by the desire to
compete for public esteem with Cimon, who made
extensive gifts to the poor in the form of dinners
and clothes.</p>

<p>In his tragedies, Euripides (480–406 B. C.),
aroused interest in the experiences, not of legendary
characters as many of his predecessors had done,
but of the ordinary members of Athenian society.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
He was a spokesman for the emancipation of
woman;<a id="FNanchor_V-6" href="#Footnote_V-6" class="fnanchor">V-6</a> his writings reveal the social changes that
were occurring in the fifth century in Athens.
Likewise, the comedies of Aristophanes reflected
social changes, and, in addition, caricatured social
conditions.</p>

<p>Hippocrates, the so-called father of medical science,
wrote several works which attracted the studious
attention of Plato. He gave as the first of two
chief causes of disease, the influence of climate,
seasons, weather on the individual.<a id="FNanchor_V-7" href="#Footnote_V-7" class="fnanchor">V-7</a> He might be
called the first anthropo-geographer. At any rate he
opened the field which has recently been so well
covered by Ellen C. Semple in her <i>Influences of
Geographic Environment</i>.</p>

<p>By their disconcerting and sceptical teachings the
Sophists, who also lived in the fifty century, B. C.,
stimulated the intellectual activities of Socrates.
The influence of the Sophist leaders, such as Protagoras,
Gorgas, Callicles, Thrasymachus, brought
forward the problem of training pupils to solve
civic questions rather than scientific or philosophical
questions. According to Plato, Callicles believed
that government was an instrument for exploiting
the masses. Thrasymachus argued that
so-called justice is that type of activity which favors
the interest of the strongest members of society,
and that might determines what is called right.<a id="FNanchor_V-8" href="#Footnote_V-8" class="fnanchor">V-8</a>
Epaminondas, the Theban statesman, personified in
his own career an unusually high interpretation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the concept of patriotism, perhaps a more unselfish
expression of patriotism than is represented by any
other political spokesman of the Hellenic states.</p>

<p>The argument of the Sophists that what is best
for the individual is best for society aroused the
antagonism of Socrates (469–399 B. C.), whose
ideas are reported by Plato and Xenophon. Socrates,
the son of an Athenian sculptor, asserted that
the qualities of justice, wisdom, temperance, and
courage, which make a person a good member of
society and which increase social welfare, are the
same qualities which make a person a good individual
and secure his individual advancement.
Socrates spent many years at the market places, on
the streets where people congregate and at the public
resorts in studying the actions of individuals and
in engaging them in conversation concerning their
moral life. As a result Socrates evolved a significant
social philosophy. The heart of this philosophy
is found in the statements that virtue is knowledge,
not in the sense of mere memorized facts but
of a thorough understanding. If a person understands
completely the good and evil phases of a
proposed act, he will choose the right. For example,
when one is completely convinced of the harmful
effects of poor teeth, he will employ the regular
services of a dentist to keep his teeth in good condition.
When he perceives the evil effects of dishonesty,
he will establish honest habits. The conclusion
might be drawn that social virtue rests upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
societary knowledge.</p>

<p>Socrates was convinced that something was fundamentally
wrong with Athenian society. Everywhere
he saw that ignorance led to vice. Only in
the mechanical and professional activities did he
discover correct action, but this was preceded by
correct knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_V-9" href="#Footnote_V-9" class="fnanchor">V-9</a></p>

<p>A good carpenter is an individual who thoroughly
understands carpentry; a good man is an individual
who truly knows the value of good actions. Similarly,
it might be said that a good urban resident
is an individual who deeply appreciates what it
means to have a city of mutually developing people.</p>

<p>Socrates wished to make all men intelligent. His
teachings raised the deep-seated social question:
How can social organization be made highly advantageous
to the individual, and the individual made
so aware of these advantages that he will always
act socially?<a id="FNanchor_V-10" href="#Footnote_V-10" class="fnanchor">V-10</a> Inasmuch as Socrates left no writings,
it is impossible to explain with certainty his
teachings. Fortunately, he left a permanent impress
of his personality on the lives of his associates,
and particularly, upon his able and brilliant
pupil, Plato.</p>

<p>In the fundamental dictum that virtue is knowledge,
Socrates is theoretically correct, but practically
he ignores the overpowering influence that
oftentimes is exerted by the instincts and established
habits. He underestimates the power that is
represented by a deeply ingrained instinct or a habit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
which has existed for several years. Instincts and
nearly all habits are firmly established neurologically,
whereas knowledge is often new to the individual
and merely a veneer on the surface of the
individual’s life. The acquisition of knowledge is
no guarantee that instincts centuries old will be
promptly overcome or re-directed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with a young child the instinctive
tendencies begin to assert themselves and to give
direction to the growth of the character of the child,
long before his mentality has unfolded and developed
to the point where he is capable of genuinely
understanding the real meaning of many forms of
activity, and where many phases of knowledge are
entirely beyond his ability to comprehend.</p>

<p>Little is known concerning Plato’s early life and
training. The most influential factors were the
life and teachings of Socrates. The strong Socratic
personality left its indelible impress upon the
thought-life of Plato. As a young man, Plato
became greatly interested in Athenian social and
civic life. When he was perhaps twenty-three years
of age, the self-styled “Fair and Good” rulers came
into control of Athens. The failure of these men,
whom history calls the Thirty Tyrants, to govern
wisely, produced an attitude of thorough disgust in
the mind of Plato. Further, the legalized murder
of Socrates by the restored democracy in 399 B. C.
aroused the bitter antagonism of Plato to the existing
forms of government. In the years which followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
the death of Socrates, popular rule produced
loose and licentious social conditions. As a consequence,
Plato turned to the realms of the thought
world in order to find a perfect society. As a result
of his contact with every-day life and government,
Plato evolved in his mind an ideal republic.</p>

<p>The Socratic principle that virtue is knowledge
was accepted by Plato. In Plato’s thinking this
proposition led to the generalization that education
is the most important thing in the world. Upon
this doctrine more than any other, Plato’s twentieth
century influence thrives.</p>

<p>What shall be the nature of a world-molding
education? Theoretically, Plato gives his answer
in his epistemology. Ideas are the ruling forces in
life. Over against the uncertain fluctuating sense
world, Plato set up a realm of eternal, changeless
ideas. An individual man is simply an ephemeral
expression of Man. Plato created a concept of unchangeable
reality which he found in Ideas. These,
alone, are the permanent, worth-while elements
which man must seek to know and understand.</p>

<p>Because of his aristocratic attitudes and of his
early disgust with the experiments in democracy in
his day, Plato turned away in his social philosophy
from the direct study of the people, such as had
engaged the attention of Socrates, to a search for
a just society in the world of ideas. This line of
thinking found expression chiefly in the <i>Republic</i>,
written during Plato’s mature manhood. A discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of these idealistic concepts is found in the
<i>Laws</i> and the <i>Politicus</i>, the latter being written
in Plato’s old age and representing a partial reaction
from the idealism of the <i>Republic</i>. Because of
its consideration of nearly every aspect of social
life from a specific viewpoint, the <i>Republic</i> may be
called the first treatise in social philosophy. While
it falls below the social writings of the Hebrews in
its dynamic and practical phases, it excels them in
its unity, its profundity, and its philosophic quality.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Plato had turned away from an inviting
though strenuous public career to a private
life of scholarly thought, his perfect society assumed
characteristics that were far from mundane.
Because Plato lived in a day of small political
groups and in a country of limited size, he limited
his ideal society—to a group represented by 5040
heads of families. Consequently it is impossible
to apply Plato’s social ideas with accuracy to a
modern metropolitan center of 5,000,000 people, or
to a nation-state of 100,000,000 people. Several
phases of Plato’s thought, however, were given a
practical turn in the <i>Laws</i>. In revealing Plato’s
social philosophy, the <i>Politicus</i>, or <i>Statesman</i> ranks
third.<a id="FNanchor_V-12" href="#Footnote_V-12" class="fnanchor">V-12</a></p>

<p>In Plato’s ideal society there is a hierarchy of
rank, which includes three classes of people: the
rulers, or true guardians; the soldiers, or auxiliaries;
and the artisans, or the industrial and agricultural
workers. In introducing the ideal state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Plato uses mature individuals.<a id="FNanchor_V-13" href="#Footnote_V-13" class="fnanchor">V-13</a> Out of the needs
and through the activities of fully-developed persons,
Plato builds an ideal commonwealth.</p>

<p>No individual is self-sufficing. Each has his
peculiar bias, or ability. By uniting, all will profit.
There are not only specialized classes, but there is
specialization within the occupational groups. An
essential rule for the building of a just society is
that each individual shall find his place in the social
order and shall fulfil his special function. Plato
recognized the need for correlating the diversities
of nature and the different types of occupation.<a id="FNanchor_V-14" href="#Footnote_V-14" class="fnanchor">V-14</a></p>

<p>The common people are engaged in the foundational
occupations as skilled artisans. The advantages
of a special education are not open to
them. They receive the common education, including
gymnastic and music training. But, in
accordance with the aristocratic strain in Plato’s
social philosophy, it is useless to try to give a higher
education to that large proportion of the population
who are mentally incapable of profiting by higher
education. The logic is good but the major premise
is faulty in this pedagogical rule.</p>

<p>The second class, the soldiers, will maintain order
at home, repel invaders, and conduct territorial
wars. The growth of population will create a demand
for more territory. Other states likewise will
need more territory, and war will become inevitable.<a id="FNanchor_V-15" href="#Footnote_V-15" class="fnanchor">V-15</a>
Plato frankly admits the territorial basis of
wars. From this factor he sees no escape, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
he declares peace to be better than war.<a id="FNanchor_V-16" href="#Footnote_V-16" class="fnanchor">V-16</a>
In his <i>Tamias</i> and <i>Critias</i> he pictured a peace-state,
“Atlantis.”</p>

<p>The soldier’s occupation is an art which requires
years of training. The chief physical trait of a true
soldier is courage. The social psychological significance
of a military régime is that soldiers are
continually inciting their country to go to war.
Such a régime raises up enemies against itself,
many and mighty, and results either in ruining the
specific people or in enslaving the foes of these
people.<a id="FNanchor_V-17" href="#Footnote_V-17" class="fnanchor">V-17</a> On the other hand, the non-soldier classes,
since they prefer to lead a peaceful life and seek to
conduct their affairs quietly, unduly endeavor to
avoid war. By degrees they become unwarlike;
their children develop a like attitude. Eventually,
they find themselves at the mercy of their enemies
and are enslaved.<a id="FNanchor_V-18" href="#Footnote_V-18" class="fnanchor">V-18</a></p>

<p>Among the members of the state there will be a
few especially able individuals, destined by birth
and reinforced by training to be rulers and true
guardians of the welfare of all.<a id="FNanchor_V-19" href="#Footnote_V-19" class="fnanchor">V-19</a> They are lovers
of wisdom and philosophy. Flabbiness of character,
drunkenness, selfishness are unbecoming to
them.<a id="FNanchor_V-20" href="#Footnote_V-20" class="fnanchor">V-20</a> Selfish living is condemned.<a id="FNanchor_V-21" href="#Footnote_V-21" class="fnanchor">V-21</a> The guardians
are characterized, according to Plato, by the
greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of
their country. They show utter repugnance to anything
that is contrary to the best interests of the
state.<a id="FNanchor_V-22" href="#Footnote_V-22" class="fnanchor">V-22</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>The guardians, however, rule aristocratically.<a id="FNanchor_V-23" href="#Footnote_V-23" class="fnanchor">V-23</a>
They do not inquire of the citizens the kind of laws
which they want passed, for the same reason that a
physician does not ask the patient the kind of medicine
which he wants. In the <i>Republic</i>, the <i>Laws</i>, and
the other dialogues where the nature of rulers and
philosophers is discussed, Plato’s “best men” show
an indifference to earthly or material things and
uniformly seek righteousness, even social righteousness.</p>

<p>The candidates for guardianship receive first the
elements of education. At twenty years of age they
must pass a general education in order that they
may go on with a special course, including arithmetic,
geometry, and astronomy.<a id="FNanchor_V-24" href="#Footnote_V-24" class="fnanchor">V-24</a> At thirty they
are subjected to a further examination, after which
the successful individuals devote five years to the
study of philosophy. At thirty-five they enter practical
life, hold minor offices, balance their theoretical
training by practical studies, and submit to diverse
temptations.<a id="FNanchor_V-25" href="#Footnote_V-25" class="fnanchor">V-25</a> They undergo a civil service examination
which extends over a period of years. At
the close they are subjected to a final series of three-fold
tests. The first test is that of logic; they must
argue successfully that it pays an individual, especially
a guardian, to serve society. The second
test is that of fear; they are faced with dangers,
for example, the dangers to life, which beset those
who undertake to rule without favoritism and without
compromising their principles when confronted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
with the ambitions and desires of powerful selfish
interests. The third test is that of pleasure; they
are submitted to all the pleasures which thrill the
heart of man. In other words, they must show
proof that the highest interest of the state is to
be the ruling interest of their lives.<a id="FNanchor_V-26" href="#Footnote_V-26" class="fnanchor">V-26</a> Neither pain
nor threats must affect their loyalty. The temptations
which come from pleasures and enchantments
must not disturb their self-control or weaken their
qualities of guardianship. From these requirements
it will be seen that Plato provided for a long period
of intensive and extensive training for the rulers.
His idea varied widely from the ancient theory of
the divine right of kings and from the current practice
of distributing political spoils to friends.</p>

<p>Plato saw that the rulers when once selected and
installed in office would be tempted to become avaricious
at the expense of the state. Instead of becoming
and remaining allied to all the citizens, they
will be prone to become tyrannical.<a id="FNanchor_V-27" href="#Footnote_V-27" class="fnanchor">V-27</a> Plato perceived
that it would be difficult, after good rulers
had been selected, to keep them on the plane of good
rulership. In order to preserve their virtue as guardians
and to remove the powerful temptation to
wink at exploitation that is carried on by the economically
powerful, Plato indicated certain protective
devices. The guardians shall be permitted
no private property beyond a few incidentals. They
shall not live in private houses, but shall dwell and
eat together. They shall receive a fixed salary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
sufficient to meet necessary expenses but no more.
They shall not be allowed to touch gold and silver
or to wear gold and silver ornaments. They shall
be taught that they are made of divine gold and
silver, and therefore shall have no need of the
earthly dross. They shall not be subject to pollution
from any earthly contacts. If the guardians
should acquire lands or moneys or homes of their
own, they would be unable to give their undivided
attention to the state, and they would become not
guardians of the welfare of the citizens, but tyrants,
plotting and being plotted against.<a id="FNanchor_V-28" href="#Footnote_V-28" class="fnanchor">V-28</a> In his zealous
care that the rulers might not be distracted from
guarding with undivided attention the interests of
the state, Plato advocated community of wives and
children for the rulers.<a id="FNanchor_V-29" href="#Footnote_V-29" class="fnanchor">V-29</a></p>

<p>The question arose: Will the people be content
to accept the division of the population into hierarchal
classes? In reply, Plato suggested that the
power of public opinion be utilized, and that all the
inhabitants of the state be taught that they are
brothers, that is, children of their common Mother
Earth. This instruction will serve to keep the
masses in a humble attitude. Further, they are to
be told that different metals have been used by
Mother Earth in making different individuals.
Those persons in whose make-up gold has been mingled
have the power of command and may become
rulers. Others who are made of silver may become
auxiliaries, or soldiers; while the masses, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
made of brass and iron, are destined to become
artisans.<a id="FNanchor_V-30" href="#Footnote_V-30" class="fnanchor">V-30</a></p>

<p>The objection is raised that people will not believe
this “audacious fiction.” The truth of the
objection is admitted, and a solution of the problem
is offered. Teach the children the gold, silver, brass
and iron fiction; and they will believe it. When they
grow to maturity, they will tell their children, who
in turn will teach it. Posterity, thus, will accept
it.<a id="FNanchor_V-31" href="#Footnote_V-31" class="fnanchor">V-31</a> In this way Plato founded his social philosophy
upon education. Plato made clear that any kind
of social or economic theory can be foisted upon
a whole people through the utilization of the educational
processes. A few selfish exploiters, by controlling
the educational system, can ruin a nation
in a generation.</p>

<p>The guardians are instructed to examine the children
in order to discover of what metals they are
made. Plato admitted a democracy of talent in
the sense that talent is likely to appear in the children
of brass and iron parents, while gold parents
may beget brass and iron children. If a gold child
is found among the children of the artisans, he is
to be encouraged and trained to become a guardian.
If a brass and iron child is found among the children
of the gold parents, he must descend the social
scale and be trained for husbandry or artisanship.<a id="FNanchor_V-32" href="#Footnote_V-32" class="fnanchor">V-32</a>
Plato foresaw the fact, now scientifically established,
that geniuses are born indiscriminately
among all classes of society from the highest to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
lowest. They are just as likely to be born in the
hovel or overcrowded tenement as in the spacious
and luxuriant palace. Consequently, society should
seek out potential genius and give it opportunities
commensurate with its possibilities and not allow
its dynamic and divine spark to be snuffed out in
a heavy-laden tenement atmosphere.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to Plato, the guardians
are to seek out the imperfect children and put them
out of the way as easily as possible and without
attracting public attention.<a id="FNanchor_V-33" href="#Footnote_V-33" class="fnanchor">V-33</a> If the capable must
devote their energies to the care of imperfect children,
they would presumably be wasting their
ability and would be prevented from devoting
themselves to upbuilding the state. This doctrine
neglects the consideration of the harsh, unsympathetic
attitude which it would engender. Although
rigorously eugenic, the doctrine is undemocratic,
unchivalric, and unChristian. It is thoroughly
aristocratic.</p>

<p>The guardians are to supervise marriage. Plato
especially deplores the fact that almost all persons
choose their life-partners in marriage without
proper regard to the kind of children that will be
procreated.<a id="FNanchor_V-34" href="#Footnote_V-34" class="fnanchor">V-34</a> The marriage relationship should
not be primarily an individual affair, but should
be governed by the thought of the children that are
not yet born and by due regard to the welfare of
the state and society.<a id="FNanchor_V-35" href="#Footnote_V-35" class="fnanchor">V-35</a> The true purpose of marriage
is not found in wealth or power or rank, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
in the procreation of healthy minded children. Marriage
is sacred in the highest degree because it is
socially necessary. Plato deplores class marriages,
that is, marriage within temperamentally similar
groups. Persons of gentle nature seek persons of
gentle nature; the courageous seek the courageous.
It would be better if the gentle would seek the
courageous in marriage, and vice versa.<a id="FNanchor_V-36" href="#Footnote_V-36" class="fnanchor">V-36</a> Marriage
is sacred, and hence should be subjected to
strict eugenic safeguards.</p>

<p>The guardians shall prevent the extremes of poverty
and riches. With far-sighted social wisdom
Plato points out that poverty is the parent of meanness
and viciousness, and that wealth leads to luxury
and indolence.<a id="FNanchor_V-37" href="#Footnote_V-37" class="fnanchor">V-37</a> Both result in discontent and
both cause the deterioration of the arts. The poor
man cannot properly equip or train himself, or enter
into his work painstakingly; the rich man will grow
careless and no longer act diligently when he comes
into the possession of unlimited wealth.<a id="FNanchor_V-38" href="#Footnote_V-38" class="fnanchor">V-38</a></p>

<p>In the acquisition of wealth the laws of imitation
function powerfully. One person accumulates
property; others are immediately stimulated to do
likewise. In consequence, all the citizens may become
lovers of money.<a id="FNanchor_V-39" href="#Footnote_V-39" class="fnanchor">V-39</a> But a money-loving public
would be disastrous to the state.</p>

<p>The larger the amount of wealth that an individual
accumulates, the more he will want to accumulate.
The momentum of the desire for money-getting
is socially destructive. The more the individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
is hypnotised by the wealth-getting delusion,
the less attention does he give to the maintenance
of virtue. When the desire for virtue is in competition
with the desire for riches, the former decreases
as the latter increases.<a id="FNanchor_V-40" href="#Footnote_V-40" class="fnanchor">V-40</a></p>

<p>When the state becomes established on a property
basis, the rich exercise power and the poor are
deprived of it.<a id="FNanchor_V-41" href="#Footnote_V-41" class="fnanchor">V-41</a> In ordinary times the rich are as
indifferent to the welfare of the poor as to the development
of virtue, but in times of group crises
they will not despise the poor. In the days of prosperity
and peace the poor man is given the hindmost
position, but when war comes, “the wiry, sunburnt
poor man” is placed in battle at the side of
the wealthy man<a id="FNanchor_V-42" href="#Footnote_V-42" class="fnanchor">V-42</a>—and social democracy obtains.
But in battle the poor man fights longer and better
than the rich man “who has never spoilt his complexion
and has plenty of superfluous flesh.” In
the words of the poor man Plato draws the astounding
conclusion that many persons are rich because
no one has had the courage to despoil them.<a id="FNanchor_V-43" href="#Footnote_V-43" class="fnanchor">V-43</a> At
this point Plato has given a striking explanation of
the rise of socialism, syndicalism, and economic
radicalism.</p>

<p>When you see paupers, according to Plato, you
may safely conclude that somewhere there are also
present thieves, robbers of temples, and malefactors.<a id="FNanchor_V-44" href="#Footnote_V-44" class="fnanchor">V-44</a>
The causes of pauperism are given as (1)
a lack of proper education, (2) ill-training, and (3)
unjust social laws and an unjust constitution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
state.<a id="FNanchor_V-45" href="#Footnote_V-45" class="fnanchor">V-45</a></p>

<p>Plato suggested two instruments for preventing
extreme wealth and poverty—legislation and education.
Each individual is to be guaranteed a minimum
amount of property. He may acquire as much
as four times this amount, but above the maximum
a one hundred per cent excess tax operates.<a id="FNanchor_V-46" href="#Footnote_V-46" class="fnanchor">V-46</a> Plato
planned a form of communism, not primarily to secure
the material well-being of the state, but to
safeguard the rulers against falling before selfish
temptations. Plato also wanted to protect the state
from splitting asunder because of the distractions
that arise from labor-capital controversies. By
educational means the children are to be trained to
be satisfied with the necessaries of life<a id="FNanchor_V-47" href="#Footnote_V-47" class="fnanchor">V-47</a>—at least
some children are to be so trained. Parents should
bequeath to their children not riches but the spirit
of reverence.<a id="FNanchor_V-48" href="#Footnote_V-48" class="fnanchor">V-48</a></p>

<p>The guardians shall be censors. They shall establish
a censorship over the arts in order to protect
the children from seeing indecent sights and hearing
vulgar sounds. The works of fiction shall be
censored in order to prevent the children from reading
and adopting bad ideas. The creative artists
shall be prevented from exhibiting forms of vice
and intemperance, in order that the future guardians
may not grow up in an atmosphere contaminated
by images of moral deformity, and in order
that all children may develop in an environment
of fair sights and should and may receive unhindered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and unhampered the good in everything.<a id="FNanchor_V-49" href="#Footnote_V-49" class="fnanchor">V-49</a></p>

<p>The guardians shall protect the <em>mores</em>. When
Plato described a perfect state, any change in the
established customs would mean retrogression.<a id="FNanchor_V-50" href="#Footnote_V-50" class="fnanchor">V-50</a>
Hence, the rulers should jealously guard the customs,
allowing no insidious innovations. Further,
if any change is permitted to take place in small
things, there may be no stopping the spirit of
change.</p>

<p>Plato rested his argument for an ideal society
upon the education of wise leaders. Their judgment
is better even than government by law. Law
is too rigid and inflexible. In view of the changeable
character of human conditions, which Plato
recognized, no final or absolute laws can be laid
down.<a id="FNanchor_V-51" href="#Footnote_V-51" class="fnanchor">V-51</a> The chief advantage of laws, however, is
not that they make men honest but that they make
men act uniformly, and hence in a socially reliable
way. Laws are to be respected because they represent
the ripe fruits of long experience.<a id="FNanchor_V-52" href="#Footnote_V-52" class="fnanchor">V-52</a></p>

<p>Considerable attention is given to penology in the
<i>Laws</i>.<a id="FNanchor_V-53" href="#Footnote_V-53" class="fnanchor">V-53</a> In view of the sanctity of custom and of
the necessity of law, obedience is a highly important
social virtue. In theory Plato is modern and scientific,
for he advocated punishment, not as a vindictive
but as a preventive and reformatory measure.<a id="FNanchor_V-54" href="#Footnote_V-54" class="fnanchor">V-54</a>
Reformation is the true aim of punishment.<a id="FNanchor_V-55" href="#Footnote_V-55" class="fnanchor">V-55</a> In
practice Plato is rigid and harsh. For example,
beggars are simply to be sent out of the city and
out of the country.<a id="FNanchor_V-56" href="#Footnote_V-56" class="fnanchor">V-56</a> The death penalty is utilized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
freely.<a id="FNanchor_V-57" href="#Footnote_V-57" class="fnanchor">V-57</a></p>

<p>Plato opened all occupations to women as well as
men, even the highest, that of ruling.<a id="FNanchor_V-58" href="#Footnote_V-58" class="fnanchor">V-58</a> The only
difference between the sexes that needs to be recognized
occupationally is that men are stronger physically
than women.<a id="FNanchor_V-59" href="#Footnote_V-59" class="fnanchor">V-59</a> Women, like men, vary in
occupational temperament. One individual is fitted
for one kind of vocation; another, for some other
type of work.</p>

<p>Although the fundamental importance of bearing
children is appreciated, Plato observed that it is
unnecessary that a woman devote her whole life
to the rearing of children. All women should have
opportunities for the development of their personalities.
Those women who have special talent
for public service should enter thereupon. Although
a social conservative Plato admits an innovation
in the ideal republic—universal woman
suffrage.</p>

<p>Since women have the same duties as men, they
receive the same opportunities for training.
Women must share in the toils of war and the defense
of their country.<a id="FNanchor_V-60" href="#Footnote_V-60" class="fnanchor">V-60</a> Women are priestesses;<a id="FNanchor_V-61" href="#Footnote_V-61" class="fnanchor">V-61</a>
they serve on committees for the regulation of marriage,
and for deciding divorce cases.<a id="FNanchor_V-62" href="#Footnote_V-62" class="fnanchor">V-62</a></p>

<p>Although Plato was averse to change, he advocated
a dynamic type of education. This educational
system, however, is to be definitely controlled
by the guardians. It is also paternalistic. Common
education shall be of two kinds: gymnastic, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
body; music, for the soul.<a id="FNanchor_V-63" href="#Footnote_V-63" class="fnanchor">V-63</a> Gymnastic training will
produce a temper of hardness, and music will lead
to gentleness. The extreme of the one is ferocity
and brutality; the extreme of the other is softness
and effeminacy.<a id="FNanchor_V-64" href="#Footnote_V-64" class="fnanchor">V-64</a> When taken together, they produce
a well-ordered personality. The one sustains
and makes bold the reason, the second moderates
and civilizes the mildness of passion.<a id="FNanchor_V-65" href="#Footnote_V-65" class="fnanchor">V-65</a> Gymnastic
exercises provide for the care and training of the
body through childhood and youth so that in maturity
the body may best serve the soul.<a id="FNanchor_V-66" href="#Footnote_V-66" class="fnanchor">V-66</a> Music,
including literature, trains through the influence of
its qualities of harmony and rhythm. For example,
through exercises in harmony the child develops
a harmonious temperament.</p>

<p>Education is not a process of acquisition, but of
the development of the powers within the individual.<a id="FNanchor_V-67" href="#Footnote_V-67" class="fnanchor">V-67</a>
It is a life-long process; it begins with
birth and continues until death. It, however, slows
up as the individual grows old. An aged person
cannot learn much, no more than he can run much.<a id="FNanchor_V-68" href="#Footnote_V-68" class="fnanchor">V-68</a>
Education in the early years of life is the most important.
As a child is educated, so will his future
be determined.<a id="FNanchor_V-69" href="#Footnote_V-69" class="fnanchor">V-69</a> A child should be taught early to
respect his parents. Great care should be given to
the first years of life. From three to six years of
age the children in Plato’s republic come under the
supervision of chosen matrons and nurses.</p>

<p>Education shall be universal, but not compulsory,
that is, all shall be taught, but not compelled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
learn. Education shall be made attractive, almost
a form of government.<a id="FNanchor_V-70" href="#Footnote_V-70" class="fnanchor">V-70</a> The laws of imitation
shall be utilized. The tutor shall carry out his
teachings in practice.<a id="FNanchor_V-71" href="#Footnote_V-71" class="fnanchor">V-71</a></p>

<p>A well-trained individual is a replica of a just
society. Plato draws a parallelism, which is inaccurate,
between the three classes in society and
three traits of the individual. The rulers, soldiers,
and artisans are compared respectively to the reason,
the spirit, and the passions of the individual.
The passions must be subordinated to the spirit,
and both must be controlled by reason. The result
will be a just individual.<a id="FNanchor_V-72" href="#Footnote_V-72" class="fnanchor">V-72</a> In society a similar
hierarchal relation shall hold between the rulers,
soldiers, and artisans. The fundamental aim in
education shall be to secure a change in the attitudes
of people. Such changes are more important
than modification in external matters. Thus, according
to Plato, the divine foundations of a state
are laid in education.</p>

<p>Religion plays a basic rôle in the ideal Republic.
Plato held that belief in God superseded in importance
the doctrine that might is right. Impiety undermines
the strength of the social kingdom. God
created the individual for the whole, but not the
whole for the individual. The worship of God is
necessary for the individual in order to prevent him
from reverting to selfishness and from making his
humanitarian beliefs purely egoistic phenomena.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Plato outlined at the start a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
republic, any change would likely constitute a deterioration.
But even an ideal state is not immune
to the entry of destructive ideas. The wise men,
the rulers, are not proof against the temptations
of absolute power. To remove the stirrings of
self-interest in the minds of the guardians, Plato
planned a communistic order. He overlooked, however,
the weaknesses of communism, but these were
pointed out at a later time by Aristotle.</p>

<p>In spite of excellent safeguards the wisdom of
the best rulers will occasionally fail them. Sooner
or later they will err. In examining the youth they
will allow warrior youth to be trained for the guardian
class. With their spirit of contention and of
ambition for honor these adventitious guardians
will start the perfect state upon the downward
road.<a id="FNanchor_V-74" href="#Footnote_V-74" class="fnanchor">V-74</a> When the rulers seek personal power and
honor, the ideal republic will be superseded by a
timocracy.</p>

<p>In a timocracy the ruler with the most private
wealth will possess the greatest personal power and
receive the highest honor. Moreover, other persons
will be stimulated, thereby, to acquire wealth and
power. In the meantime the masses will lose nearly
everything. The result is an oligarchy in which
the wealthy are honored and made rulers.<a id="FNanchor_V-75" href="#Footnote_V-75" class="fnanchor">V-75</a> The
poor are treated with dishonor and deprived of
position.</p>

<p>In such an oligarchic state there is a fundamental
division; there are two states instead of one. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
spirit, the rich and the poor comprise separate
states. They live in the same territory but are conspiring
against one another.<a id="FNanchor_V-76" href="#Footnote_V-76" class="fnanchor">V-76</a> Social stability is destroyed
by the conflicts between the extremes of
countless riches and utter poverty. The propertyless
hate and conspire against the propertied.<a id="FNanchor_V-77" href="#Footnote_V-77" class="fnanchor">V-77</a>
Civil war ensues. Because the wealthy have fallen
into carelessness and extravagance, and because the
poor possess superior numbers, the poor are the
victors. A democracy—the rule of the Demos—comes
into being. Everyone rules.</p>

<p>But the populace is not fitted to rule. They are
without experience. Since the drones are numerous
among the common people, the drones manage
almost everything in a democracy.<a id="FNanchor_V-78" href="#Footnote_V-78" class="fnanchor">V-78</a> Excess of liberty
among people untrained for liberty leads to
anarchy. Individuals will set themselves up as the
special friends of the common people. These self-appointed
friends of the people will prove to be
self-seeking tyrants; the democracy will be transformed
into a tyranny—the lowest state of all in
Plato’s five-fold devolution.</p>

<p>With distrust of the masses and with a paternalistic
government, Plato coupled a belief that the
individual must participate in the life of society.
Social justice does not consist in doing good to one’s
friends and ill to one’s enemies, or in catering to
the interests of the most powerful. The theory that
might is right is repudiated.<a id="FNanchor_V-79" href="#Footnote_V-79" class="fnanchor">V-79</a> A just society is one
in which every person has found his place of greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
usefulness to the state and fulfils his entire obligations
in that place. On the whole Plato exhibited
an impassioned faith in the moral and social order.</p>

<p>Plato believed that Ideas are real and that they
are the tools with which the world is made over.
He perceived perfect Forms, even a perfect social
Form. Through intellectual control, Plato planned
a new social order.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Aristotle and Grecian Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Aristotle (384–322 B. C.), the distinguished pupil
of Plato, did not make, like his master, a unified
contribution to social thought. He sacrificed unity
for the examination of parts. Aristotle was an
opportunist, a pragmatist, and a practical student
of conditions and constitutions. Unlike Plato, Aristotle
did not look for Ideas separate from but in
things.</p>

<p>Aristotle studied 158 constitutions inductively
and comparatively. His primary attention was
given to what is, rather than to what ought to be.
His eyes were directed first of all to the parts, and
then to the whole. In this examination he found
that the parts are related, and further, that they
hold a developmental relation. Instead of Plato’s
perfection, we shall now consider Aristotle’s process
of becoming. Although unsystematic, the social
ideas of Aristotle reveal the concepts of process and
progress.</p>

<p>In Aristotle’s <i>Ethics</i> the discussion of virtue is
socially valuable. Virtue is a mean. Virtue is an
impulse which is expressed neither in excess or in
deficiency. It is an impulse expressed temperately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
until it becomes a habit. Excess and deficiency
are equally fatal. The coward is he who avoids
and fears anything; the foolhardy is he who rushes
into danger anywhere.<a id="FNanchor_VI-1" href="#Footnote_VI-1" class="fnanchor">VI-1</a> Liberality is the mean between
prodigality and avarice; civility is the mean
between obsequiousness and insolence. Virtue itself
is the mean between self-indulgence and asceticism.
In virtue, lies happiness, man’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">summum bonum</i>.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i> affords a searching analysis
of many phases of societary life. The family and
the state are by nature prior to the individual, since
the whole must exist before any individual part.<a id="FNanchor_VI-2" href="#Footnote_VI-2" class="fnanchor">VI-2</a>
When isolated, the individual is not self-sufficient.
Thus, the state is founded on the social needs of
the individual. By virtue of these social needs,
man possesses the gregarious, or social, instinct.
By nature, man is a political animal,<a id="FNanchor_VI-3" href="#Footnote_VI-3" class="fnanchor">VI-3</a> that is, he is
a being who by nature or necessity lives in association
with his kind. Man can attain his highest good
only as a member of society.</p>

<p>Property is accorded by Aristotle a fundamental
social position. Physical necessities can best be
provided through the efforts of individuals. Communal
ownership of property on a large scale will
fail. In referring to Plato’s communism, Aristotle
declared: “For that which is common to the greatest
number has the least care bestowed upon it.”<a id="FNanchor_VI-4" href="#Footnote_VI-4" class="fnanchor">VI-4</a>
Further, when one feels a thing to be his own, how
much greater is his pleasure in it.<a id="FNanchor_VI-5" href="#Footnote_VI-5" class="fnanchor">VI-5</a> Then, if one has
private property, he may have the great pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
which comes from making gifts to others. Moreover,
communism will lead to an unusual amount
of quarrelling; those who work faithfully will feel
aggrieved when they see that those who work dilettantishly
receive and consume a full portion.<a id="FNanchor_VI-6" href="#Footnote_VI-6" class="fnanchor">VI-6</a></p>

<p>Aristotle deprecated land equalization. Equalization
of the desire for land is urged. Instead of
dividing land equally or of establishing communism
in land, Aristotle advocated that the higher classes
be trained not to desire more land. He also stated
that speculators and land schemers should be prevented
from getting more land.<a id="FNanchor_VI-7" href="#Footnote_VI-7" class="fnanchor">VI-7</a></p>

<p>The communism in wives and children that Plato
suggested, Aristotle denounced as impracticable and
foolish. Such a procedure will weaken friendship
and destroy love. Moreover, it will break up the
unity of the state.<a id="FNanchor_VI-8" href="#Footnote_VI-8" class="fnanchor">VI-8</a></p>

<p>Aristotle held the prevalent disdainful attitude
toward manual labor, and theoretically justified
slavery. A slave is a person who by nature is a
slave, a person who by nature expresses himself
through bodily action. He is unable to guide himself
by means of reason.<a id="FNanchor_VI-9" href="#Footnote_VI-9" class="fnanchor">VI-9</a></p>

<p>The subject of social control and government received
extended treatment from Aristotle. After
considering a great variety of forms of government,
he avoided a dogmatic choice of any particular
form. He arrived at what is the modern, scientific
conclusion, namely, that no one form of government
is to be worshipped to the exclusion of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
other types. A successful, or virtuous, government
depends on the attitude of the people. Human nature
must be changed. All people must become
socially virtuous before a perfected government
can be established.</p>

<p>Theoretically, Aristotle believed that the best
government would come through the absolute rulership
of one man, provided that there is available a
man pre-eminently wise and virtuous. But practically,
Aristotle held that in choosing a form of
government which will succeed, it is necessary to
consider the actual social conditions, the state of
development of the people, and the attitude of the
ruler or rulers. It does not matter whether one
person, or a few persons, or a large number of persons
perform the function of ruler so long as the
best interests of the state are kept uppermost. If
the interests of the entire group are the guiding
principles, then royalty, aristocracy, or constitutionalism
is commendable. The one, the few, or the
many are good rulers, providing they are dominated
by the common interests. In these declarations
Aristotle overlooked the fact that participation in
government by the governed is essential. He also
neglected the fact that a “best” ruler would be subject
to very many temptations as a result of personifying
in himself all the forms of political, economic,
and social power that exist within the state. After
a period of time he would probably yield to some
interests which are inimical to the welfare of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
whole.<a id="FNanchor_VI-10" href="#Footnote_VI-10" class="fnanchor">VI-10</a></p>

<p>When private interests control the government,
the resultant forms of government are either
tyranny, oligarchy, or democracy. According to
Aristotle the chief difference between oligarchy and
democracy is that an oligarchy is the rule of the
rich and a democracy is the rule of the poor. Evidently,
he believed that the poor are as selfish as the
rich and that the poor are incapable of being
trained to the levels of virtuous citizenship.</p>

<p>Although Aristotle is aristocratic in his political
science and advocated frequently the rule of the
best few, he endorsed a constitutional republic.
Such a form of government will succeed where
there are many wise and virtuous individuals. He
admitted that in large numbers there is a stability
of judgment and that common sense bulks large.
Under constitutional government, the extremes will
cancel one another, and the virtuous mean will rule.
Large numbers of persons are less likely to be corrupted
than a few persons or even the one best person.<a id="FNanchor_VI-11" href="#Footnote_VI-11" class="fnanchor">VI-11</a></p>

<p>There are two fundamentals in a good government:
first, actual obedience of the laws by the
citizens; second, the social goodness of the laws.
Aristotle’s formula for an ideal society is this:
virtuous people and good laws, both judged by the
common welfare. And practically, the form of
political organization—a monarchy, an aristocracy,
or a constitutional republic—depends upon the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of the members of the social order on the incline of
socialization.</p>

<p>If a constitutional republic is established, then
rotation in office should be practiced. The tenure
of office should be restricted to six months.<a id="FNanchor_VI-12" href="#Footnote_VI-12" class="fnanchor">VI-12</a> An
office should rarely be held more than once by the
same person.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the laws should be changed
slowly.<a id="FNanchor_VI-13" href="#Footnote_VI-13" class="fnanchor">VI-13</a> Law has no power to make people obey
in spirit, except through force of habit. The state
must guard itself against small changes in laws.
Any apparently slight neglect or disregard of law
is insidious; transgression creeps in unperceived.<a id="FNanchor_VI-14" href="#Footnote_VI-14" class="fnanchor">VI-14</a>
At first, small transgressions may not be observed;
then, they may gain such momentum that they will
ruin the state. Hence, there should be at all times
strict observance of laws.</p>

<p>The major chord in Aristotle’s ideal society is the
social mean. The existence of two classes only, the
very rich and the very poor, will bring disaster to
the state. The very wealthy consider themselves
above legalistic or social authority; the very poor
are too degraded to understand the necessity for
and the reason for authority.<a id="FNanchor_VI-15" href="#Footnote_VI-15" class="fnanchor">VI-15</a> In fact, all who
possess, not simply an unusual degree of wealth, but
great beauty, great strength or a “noble” birth feel
that they should be accorded special privileges.
Further, not only those who are very poor, but also
the persons who are very weak, or very disgraced
find it difficult to follow the dictates of law or of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
social reason. With the privileged characters who
possess a superabundance of advantages, the arrogant
attitude developed when they were yet children.
At home, they received special considerations;
they did not learn obedience within the small
family group. In consequence, how could they be
expected to be obedient citizens within the larger
nation-group? The rich are likely to become insolent
and avaricious; they will rule despotically.<a id="FNanchor_VI-16" href="#Footnote_VI-16" class="fnanchor">VI-16</a>
Not everyone can bear either prosperity or adversity.
An increase in prosperity in any part of society
should be carefully noted, and that part of
society should be placed under surveillance. No one
should receive extraordinary power, either from
friends or through money. Even the pre-eminent
are not above egotism.</p>

<p>A society is safest when the middle class is in
control.<a id="FNanchor_VI-17" href="#Footnote_VI-17" class="fnanchor">VI-17</a> The states will likely be well administered
in which the middle class is numerous. Persons of
about equal condition do not plot against others;
neither are they plotted against. A middle class
prevents both the arrogant wealthy and the impetuous
proletariat from dominating the state. “Inequality
is the source of all revolutions.”</p>

<p>Poverty is a cause of revolution and crime.<a id="FNanchor_VI-18" href="#Footnote_VI-18" class="fnanchor">VI-18</a> In
time of war, it is important that the poor be well
fed else they will cause disturbances. Aristotle
might have added that in time of peace the poor
should be able to feed themselves well else they will
in due season cause revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>But poverty is not the only cause of crime.
Riches often lead to crime. Wealth causes the commitment
of greater crimes than does poverty. The
greatest offenses are not occasioned by necessity but
by excess.<a id="FNanchor_VI-19" href="#Footnote_VI-19" class="fnanchor">VI-19</a> In order to gratify some passion or
desire, crime is often committed. Of the passions
ambition and avarice are the chief causes of crime.<a id="FNanchor_VI-20" href="#Footnote_VI-20" class="fnanchor">VI-20</a>
Intoxication produces crime.<a id="FNanchor_VI-21" href="#Footnote_VI-21" class="fnanchor">VI-21</a></p>

<p>The causes of social revolution are manifold.
The desire for equality and the desire for inequality
are common factors.<a id="FNanchor_VI-22" href="#Footnote_VI-22" class="fnanchor">VI-22</a> Inferiors revolt in order that
they may attain a state of equality with other persons.
Equals revolt in order that they may gain
superior levels of honor and status. Aristotle cited
a long list of additional factors in social revolution:
insolence, fear, political graft, a disproportionate
increase of wealth in some part of the state,
neglect of trifles in the observance of laws, dissimilarity
in elements such as racial. The fundamental
cause, however, of social revolution is love of gain
and honor.</p>

<p>Aristotle was not a militarist, for he believed that
war in itself is not a social good. No people should
be trained to conquer and obtain dominion over
neighboring states.<a id="FNanchor_VI-23" href="#Footnote_VI-23" class="fnanchor">VI-23</a> Military states are safe only
when they are at war. After they declare peace the
weight of their military burdens brings about their
downfall.<a id="FNanchor_VI-24" href="#Footnote_VI-24" class="fnanchor">VI-24</a></p>

<p>The principle of social telesis, which has been
recently developed by Lester F. Ward, was foreseen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
by Aristotle. A society of individuals, like the individual
himself, has a work to do.<a id="FNanchor_VI-25" href="#Footnote_VI-25" class="fnanchor">VI-25</a> It should
adapt itself to its task.</p>

<p>Aristotle was a public health advocate. The location
for an ideal city should be carefully chosen. It
should be selected, first of all, with reference to the
health of the citizens. This point is of greater importance
than that of locating a city wisely for the
purpose of public administration or war.<a id="FNanchor_VI-26" href="#Footnote_VI-26" class="fnanchor">VI-26</a> The importance
of a pure water supply is given almost a
modern emphasis.</p>

<p>The question of eugenics received the attention
of Aristotle. In order that children may be as
physically sound as possible, legislators should give
special attention to the institution of marriage.
Youthful marriages are condemned because the
children that are born to such unions will be wanting
in respect for their parents.<a id="FNanchor_VI-27" href="#Footnote_VI-27" class="fnanchor">VI-27</a> Late marriages
will be unsatisfactory because there will be too great
difference between the ages of the parents and their
children. The marriage of a man and a woman
whose ages are widely disproportionate will lead
to misunderstandings and quarrels. According to
the rigorous, unsympathetic dictum of Aristotle, no
deformed child shall be permitted to live.<a id="FNanchor_VI-28" href="#Footnote_VI-28" class="fnanchor">VI-28</a> Even
the advocates of modern birth control may turn for
encouragement to Aristotle.</p>

<p>In the marriage relation there is inequality. The
man is by nature better fitted to command than the
woman.<a id="FNanchor_VI-29" href="#Footnote_VI-29" class="fnanchor">VI-29</a> The chief characteristic of a good wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
is obedience to her husband—a doctrine which is
patriarchal. Unfaithfulness of either sex in marriage
is disgraceful.<a id="FNanchor_VI-30" href="#Footnote_VI-30" class="fnanchor">VI-30</a></p>

<p>Aristotle, like Plato, considers education the leading
social force. There is a fundamental educational
problem: Shall youth be trained primarily
(1) to do useful work, (2) to be virtuous, or (3) to
gain higher knowledge?<a id="FNanchor_VI-31" href="#Footnote_VI-31" class="fnanchor">VI-31</a> No final answer is given.
Aristotle’s conception of education, however, is
paternalistic.</p>

<p>Utilitarian education possesses a danger line.
To be seeking always after the useful prevents one
from developing a free and exalted soul.<a id="FNanchor_VI-32" href="#Footnote_VI-32" class="fnanchor">VI-32</a> Utilitarian
education should cease when it cramps the
body or spirit and makes either less fit for the practice
of virtue.</p>

<p>Gymnastic education should never be professionalized
or allowed to hinder the individual’s higher
education.<a id="FNanchor_VI-33" href="#Footnote_VI-33" class="fnanchor">VI-33</a> The excessive training which leads to
Olympic victories is anti-social, because the constitution
of the given individual is exhausted. Music
is valuable inasmuch as it has the power of forming
character.<a id="FNanchor_VI-34" href="#Footnote_VI-34" class="fnanchor">VI-34</a> The persons who are engaged
in seriously-minded occupations need amusements
which will give relaxation.</p>

<p>In summary of Aristotle’s social thought it may
be said that the Stagirite introduced the comparative
method of studying human institutions. He
demonstrated the relative value of institutions,
showing that those which are best for one age of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
society will be worthless for a later period. In
order to meet changing social needs and conditions,
institutions must change. There is a fundamental
evolution in social changes.</p>

<p>A communistic social organization, according to
Aristotle, is psycho-sociologically untenable. The
importance of the middle classes is socially inestimable.
Laws should be respected in small particulars.
The attitude of the members of society
toward their social organizations is more important
than the type of organization itself. Human conduct
in the mass is to a degree predictable.</p>

<p>After the time of Aristotle, Hellenic life degenerated.
Political corruption, military intrigue, and
intellectual scepticism vitiated the Hellenic morality
that was founded on custom. The ideal, held by
Plato and Aristotle, of man as an integral part of
a constructive social order was supplanted by a
philosophy of pure individualism.</p>

<p>In Athens, Epicurus (341–270 B. C.) became the
leader of the popular hedonistic philosophy with its
emphasis upon pleasure. Self-sacrifice and noble
conduct in the social sense are foreign to Epicureanism.
Friends should be sought, not for the
sake of cultivating their friendship, but for the
pleasure to the seeker. If you treat other persons
unjustly, they will retaliate; therefore, treat others
justly.</p>

<p>Stoicism which was founded in Athens by Zeno
reached its culmination among the Romans and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
hence will be discussed in the following chapter.
Polybius (203–121 B. C.), known as the last Hellenic
social philosopher, developed a theory of social
evolution, based on the belief that people associate
because of the selfish benefits that accrue, and on
the fact that group approval and disapproval play a
leading part in the development of human attitudes.</p>

<p>Grecian social thought is noteworthy because of
its intellectual foundations. It ignored many affective
elements, and for that reason it became one-sided
and unbalanced. It was rational rather than
affective or supernatural. It was designed to
meet the needs of this life. It moved away from
authority and towards opportunism.</p>

<p>Economically, Hellenic social thought assumed
or justified human slavery. It postulated a democracy,
but a democracy builded on the backs of thousands
of slaves. In practice at the height of the
Athenian democracy there were only about 25,000
free Athenians as against 300,000 slaves. Women
were not enfranchised. The governments put
slaves into the armies, and ultimately attempted to
throw out a commercial net over the other Mediterranean
states. As a result they lost the spirit of
democracy. The whole system and concept of
democracy was undermined by the debilitating influences
of an industrial autocracy. The social
thought of the Greek was limited in its actual application
largely to the privileged few, who aristocratically
ignored the needs of the helpless many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>Grecian social thought at the height of the
Athenian democracy did achieve, however, for its
day and epoch, a unique degree of expression
among the free citizens. For example, in the
matter of athletics and recreation, the Athenians
worked together in furnishing themselves organized
group activities. Their athletic contests were
of a free community nature, untrammelled by commercialized
motives. In furnishing recreation for
themselves, they co-operated, they acted as community
units. Moreover, in these community activities
they generated in themselves the spirit of a
genuine democratic consciousness.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of Grecian social thought were
preserved by the Romans, without being augmented
by them. Together with the Hebrew and early
Christian social thought, Grecian social thought
laid the foundations for the rise of modern social
science, and even of sociology.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Roman Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Roman social thought is an outgrowth of Hellenic
philosophic movements. It is represented in
part by the codification of important phases of
societary control—the product of the legalistic
genius of the Romans. Stoicism, moreover, greatly
affected and conditioned the meager social thinking
of the Roman scholars.</p>

<p>Lucretius (99–55 B. C.) was the chief Roman
exponent of Epicureanism. In his story of social
evolution he began with the various phases of the
biological struggle for existence, and proceeded to
depict in a remarkably significant fashion the
origins of social practices and customs.<a id="FNanchor_VII-1" href="#Footnote_VII-1" class="fnanchor">VII-1</a> Although
his data are of questionable value, his descriptions
of social origins often run strangely parallel to
modern findings.</p>

<p>The ideal commonwealth of Cicero (106–43 B. C.)
is founded on the belief that Rome has the
possibility of becoming an ideal state.<a id="FNanchor_VII-2" href="#Footnote_VII-2" class="fnanchor">VII-2</a> The best
ideas in this connection were selected by Cicero
from the Aristotelian, Epicurean, and Stoic philosophies.
Cicero was apparently an exponent of
honest statesmanship and finally gave his life for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
civic efficiency. He argued that a child should not
be punished by either a parent or a teacher in a fit
of anger. Corporal punishment should be considered
only when other methods fail to discipline.</p>

<p>The descriptive studies of Julius Caesar (100–44 B. C.)
are noteworthy. The <i>Commentaries</i> present
social studies of contemporary conditions; they possess
modern value. In a large number of instances
the accuracy of Caesar’s social notes has been
verified.</p>

<p>The teachings of the Roman Stoics may be traced
back to the Socratic formula: Virtue is knowledge.
Virtue is knowledge which grows out of practical
human conduct. Unlike Aristotle, the Stoics believed
that sympathy is a disease. It is pathological
and hence must be overcome. In helping other people
the wise individual does not allow the emotion
of pity to appear.</p>

<p>Contrary to the theory of the Epicureans, the
Stoics taught that pleasure is a tiresome and sickly
goal. Seneca (4 B. C.-65 A. D.), a leading Roman
Stoic, declared: “I am seeking to find what is good
for a man, not for his belly.”<a id="FNanchor_VII-3" href="#Footnote_VII-3" class="fnanchor">VII-3</a> Virtue, according to
Stoic philosophy, consists in living a free and undisturbed
life. A line was drawn between the virtuous
and non-virtuous, between a few virtuous and
a multitude of fools. This doctrine tends to engender
in the few virtuous a contemptuous regard
for the pig-trough philosophy of the many.</p>

<p>This tendency, however, was offset by the Stoic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
belief that all persons originally possess the same
nature and that all are children of the same universal
Spirit. Social differences, hence, are external
and superficial. Beneath the surface of human
nature there is a cosmopolitanism which constitutes
a passive brotherhood of man. Brotherly love
should rule, according to the Stoics, but it should
rule temperately, and not in such a way as to disturb
the individual’s self control. Brotherly love should
be not a passionate but an intellectual element.</p>

<p>In his treatise on Benefits, Seneca makes benevolence
the most social of all virtues; and ingratitude
the most venal of all crimes. Marcus Aurelius
(121–180 A. D.) gave the social injunction: Love
mankind.<a id="FNanchor_VII-4" href="#Footnote_VII-4" class="fnanchor">VII-4</a> Living should consist in passing from
one social act to another.<a id="FNanchor_VII-5" href="#Footnote_VII-5" class="fnanchor">VII-5</a> This is a social world;
men exist for the sake of one another.<a id="FNanchor_VII-6" href="#Footnote_VII-6" class="fnanchor">VII-6</a></p>

<p>The Stoic Emperor declared that God is social
and that individuals are part of God’s universe.
Each individual is a component part of the social
system, and hence every act of the individual is an
integral phase of social life.<a id="FNanchor_VII-7" href="#Footnote_VII-7" class="fnanchor">VII-7</a> Inasmuch as the Intelligence
of the universe is social, human society
functions as a phase of the cosmic co-ordination.
We are all co-laborers and co-operators. Even the
persons who find fault and who hinder what happens,
are performing useful co-operative functions.<a id="FNanchor_VII-8" href="#Footnote_VII-8" class="fnanchor">VII-8</a>
That which is harmful to the swarm is likewise
harmful to the individual. Man is a citizen of the
world.<a id="FNanchor_VII-9" href="#Footnote_VII-9" class="fnanchor">VII-9</a> The services of a good citizen are never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
lost. The good citizen does good chiefly by the
example he sets.<a id="FNanchor_VII-10" href="#Footnote_VII-10" class="fnanchor">VII-10</a></p>

<p>But the cosmopolitanism of the Stoics never
extended beyond a passive interest in the world of
affairs. It meant that the individual should be
agreeable with other persons, that he should be
tolerant of the weaknesses of others, and that he
should be aware constantly that others are watching
him and likely to copy the example he sets.<a id="FNanchor_VII-11" href="#Footnote_VII-11" class="fnanchor">VII-11</a>
Stoicism requires the suppression of anger and the
exercising of clemency toward all human beings.
While Stoicism does not extend so far in its profession
as Christianity’s doctrine of brotherhood
of man, it represents a broader viewpoint of life
than any code of conduct which previously had
developed in the non-Christian world.</p>

<p>The purpose of punishment, according to Seneca,
is two-fold: either to reform the evil-doer; or to
prevent the operation of his evil influence and to
stop him from setting harmful examples.<a id="FNanchor_VII-12" href="#Footnote_VII-12" class="fnanchor">VII-12</a> The
social medicine must be determined, quantitatively
and qualitatively, by the nature of the offender and
the offense. Above all things else, he who administers
punishment must not act in anger. Justice
cannot be angry.<a id="FNanchor_VII-13" href="#Footnote_VII-13" class="fnanchor">VII-13</a> Lynch procedure is entirely contrary
to the teachings of Stoicism.</p>

<p>First of all, thieves and robbers should be instructed
in the error of their ways. Obtain their
point of view and administer punishment accordingly.
Pity them. The individual who understands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
why criminals commit offenses is prevented from
becoming angry with them.<a id="FNanchor_VII-14" href="#Footnote_VII-14" class="fnanchor">VII-14</a> Aurelius, like Jesus,<a id="FNanchor_VII-15" href="#Footnote_VII-15" class="fnanchor">VII-15</a>
gave the injunction: Love even those who do
wrong. Aurelius, like Paul,<a id="FNanchor_VII-16" href="#Footnote_VII-16" class="fnanchor">VII-16</a> urged an attitude of
charity toward wrong-doers.<a id="FNanchor_VII-17" href="#Footnote_VII-17" class="fnanchor">VII-17</a></p>

<p>The Stoics condemned luxurious living and
fashion racing. True riches consists not in augmenting
one’s fortune, but in abating the desires
for securing material wealth.<a id="FNanchor_VII-18" href="#Footnote_VII-18" class="fnanchor">VII-18</a> The words of Emperor
Aurelius regarding ostentatious living do not
seem out of place when applied to the modern display
of wealth. Seneca asserted that he would
despise wealth as much when he has it as when he
does not possess it.</p>

<p>Stoicism urged the Aristotelian social mean regarding
property. Much property is a burden and
a cause of worry and fear. It excites envy in
others. The best society is that which is characterized
by neither poverty nor plenty. The poor
should not condemn riches, and the wealthy err in
extolling the benefits of poverty—each is speaking
of a situation which is objective to him and outside
his sphere. Since it is objective to him, he is not
qualified to speak concerning it. The individual is
a great man who is not corrupted by his wealth; but
he is a greater man who is honestly poor in the
midst of plenty.<a id="FNanchor_VII-19" href="#Footnote_VII-19" class="fnanchor">VII-19</a> Riches constitute a power to do
evil, hence mediocrity of fortune with a gentleness
of mind represents the best status.<a id="FNanchor_VII-20" href="#Footnote_VII-20" class="fnanchor">VII-20</a></p>

<p>Stoicism enunciated excellent social ideals, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
were, however, passively intellectual. They were
not affectively dynamic. Despite their implications,
they begat social inertia. The teachings of the
Stoics removed rather than instilled a sense of public
responsibility. The doctrines are available to
the few rather than to the masses, although a
Roman slave, Epictetus, as an exception, rose to a
full interpretation of Stoic principles. The social
ideals and concepts of the Stoics did not possess
enough power to regenerate a degenerate society.
They had sufficient strength, however, to maintain
themselves in a voluptuous and pleasure-seeking
world. They performed the exceedingly useful
function of preparing the way for the invasion of
the Roman Empire by the new and active Christian
propaganda. The teachings of the Stoics made
easier the conquest of Rome by Christianity. They
softened a little an otherwise hard-hearted world.</p>

<p>As a class the Romans were men of action.
They were soldiers and administrators. The name
of Rome is still synonymous with power. On the
whole it must be said that the Romans made little
contribution to societary thought.</p>

<p>The constructive work of the Romans was legal
and administrative. They built up a special social
science—legal science. The legal genius of the
Romans emphasized the rights of contract, of private
property, of interest. Although this attention
to the development of individualistic institutions
was fatal to the rise of new social attitudes and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
an increase in the sense of social responsibility, it
nevertheless was instrumental in constructing a
stable framework for the evolution of the social
process.</p>

<p>The Romans preserved a portion of Hellenic culture.
The teachings of Plato and Aristotle were
saved to modern civilization. Credit is due the
Romans for receiving, keeping, working over, and
handing on a part of the best Hellenic civilization.</p>

<p>Roman thought accentuated military principles of
authority, even to the point of autocracy. It tended
to crush the unprivileged populace. It tried to keep
the masses contented by generous state aid. It
denied to personality its complete individual and
social expressions. In building an individualistic
framework which would provide an orderly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i>
for the rise of the institution of private property,
it ignored the needs of the uneducated and poverty-enslaved
masses for a full measure of liberty.</p>

<p>Rome developed the concept of organized power.
The organizing ability of the Romans was marvelous,
an organizing power that lives today in and
through the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The greatest gift of Rome was its Stoic concepts.
Although these originated in Hellas, they attained
their maturity in Rome. They opened the way for
the reception of the Christian social concepts of
love, service, brotherhood of man.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Early Christian Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Christian social thought is the direct outgrowth
of Hebrew social concepts. Amos and Hosea and
Isaiah paved the way for the social teachings of
Jesus. The social commandments of the Old Testament
were the progenitors of the modified social
injunctions of the New Testament. Job, the social
citizen, was not an unworthy precursor of Jesus,
the lover of humanity. Out of the love and tender
care for children which thrived in Hebrew homes
there arose the concept of the brotherhood of man
and the Fatherhood of God—the two cardinal principles
of Christianity.</p>

<p>Jesus gave expression to no system of social
thought, but uttered social principles and concepts
which, when put together, constituted the basis of
a new social order. He dealt with personalities
rather than with institutions. He looked to the individual
rather than to the mass. He emphasized
functions rather than structures. He proclaimed
the need for socio-religious personalities. If he
could get these, he was sure of the ultimate societal
results. He foresaw a perfect society—the Kingdom
of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>Unlike Plato and Aristotle, Jesus was a continual
student of everyday life. Like Socrates, Jesus was
fond of people. He was a student of individual
and social affairs. He mixed with all types of
human beings. Like Socrates, he wrote practically
nothing. Unlike Socrates, Jesus had a dynamic element
in his nature which forbade him to remain
content to argue with people (after the Socratic
manner), but which drove him to help and to heal.
He went about doing good. The Gospel records
are replete with instance after instance of his work
in healing the sick of their infirmities. He was not,
however, a physician but a teacher and a savior
from sin and evil.</p>

<p>Behind all the teachings of Jesus, there is the
concept of a perfect human order. This Kingdom
begins in the hearts of individuals.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-1" href="#Footnote_VIII-1" class="fnanchor">VIII-1</a> It is a spirit
or an attitude of mind which leads the individual
toward co-operative living. The Kingdom may
come on earth as well as in heaven. Consider the
picture of a harmonious community life which
Jesus gave when lamenting over Jerusalem: “How
often would I have gathered thy children together,
as a hen doth gather her brood together under her
wings, and ye would not!”<a id="FNanchor_VIII-2" href="#Footnote_VIII-2" class="fnanchor">VIII-2</a></p>

<p>Jesus extended the concept of brotherhood.
Whoever shall do the will of God is a brother to
me.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-3" href="#Footnote_VIII-3" class="fnanchor">VIII-3</a> The world, under God, is one family. The
Kingdom, therefore, is to include all human beings,
who worship God in spirit and in truth and who at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the same time love their fellowmen in justice and
co-operative living.</p>

<p>The ideal society is organic. It grows from good
examples. Live so that other persons, seeing the
helpfulness of your life, may live likewise. The
Kingdom grows like a grain of mustard seed, which
finally becomes a tree in whose branches the birds
find homes.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-4" href="#Footnote_VIII-4" class="fnanchor">VIII-4</a> Love grows, and like leaven, permeates
and transforms the whole mass,—the result
is the perfect Kingdom.</p>

<p>God is the spiritual leader of the new society, to
whom Jesus prayed in the social term, Our Father.
God is the personification of love. God loved the
sinful world so much that he gave his only son to
the task of saving not simply the Jews or modern
Europeans, but the whole world from all sins. The
Star which guided the Magi was God’s service Star,
announcing that he had given his only son in the
war against sin.</p>

<p>Love is the new note that is to re-form the world.
Love is the scientific principle from which all other
true sociological concepts are derived. Love received
the most perfect human expression in the
personality and life of Jesus, who came not for self
glory but to save people from hate and sin; who
sought not the sheep to oppress and slay them for
his own gratification, but to direct them, when lost,
back to safe living; who sought not to weigh down
the burdened with unjust taxes and harsh living
conditions, but to relieve and give rest to the heavy-laden:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
who cared less for the upper Four Hundred
than for the lower Four Hundred Million.</p>

<p>The principle of love compels the members of the
Kingdom to show mercy. God is full of mercy,
therefore, let his followers show mercy. Love forgives.
The Christian citizen is instructed to become
reconciled with his brother citizen before
worshipping at the altar of God.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-6" href="#Footnote_VIII-6" class="fnanchor">VIII-6</a> If the individual
would be forgiven of his sins, he must acquire the
habit of forgiving other persons. He must be careful
not to judge harshly, lest other persons judge
him harshly. He should forgive others seventy
times seven times, that is, without stint or measure.</p>

<p>St. Luke, the physician, recites the story of a
loving father. The prodigal son impetuously demanded
his share of the inheritance, and going into
a far country, wasted his substance in riotous living.
But upon showing true remorse for these
exceedingly grave offenses, his father received him
back with a loving, forgiving heart, a feast, the
best robes, and music and dancing. One of the
malefactors who was crucified with Christ, showed
a penitent heart at the last moment and received
forgiveness from the loving, dying Christ. Since
no one is without sin, no one has a right to be unforgiving.
Even the woman taken in adultery came
within the law of forgiving love.</p>

<p>The societary principle of love is the major chord
of Christianity. It is Christianity’s unscientific but
greatest gift to sociology. It has become the fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
concept of sociology. To the Old Testament
type of love which urged the individual to
love his neighbor and to love the alien and stranger,
Jesus repeatedly insisted upon a love that is still
greater, namely, a love which will include enemies.
Love your enemies.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-7" href="#Footnote_VIII-7" class="fnanchor">VIII-7</a> Jesus himself exemplified this
form of love. He made no idle interpretation of an
impossible love, but demonstrated and lived a love
which forgave his enemies, even those who mockingly,
shamelessly nailed him to a cross. So great
is the drawing power of this almost superhuman
love which Jesus expressed in deeds that he himself
predicted that if he were lifted up he would draw
all people unto him.</p>

<p>Love fills people with compassion. The Gospels
are replete with references to the fact that wherever
Jesus saw sickness, poverty, sin, he was moved with
compassion. The illustrations range from the
blind men by the wayside to the bread-hungry multitudes,
from the unclean leper in Galilee to murderous
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Love is cosmopolitan. All peoples are entitled to
know the meaning of Christian love.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-8" href="#Footnote_VIII-8" class="fnanchor">VIII-8</a> Both Jew
and Gentile shall feel its warming glow. The
Samaritan lives it. Loving neighborliness includes
more than priestly and Levitical acts; it involves
Samaritan kindness. The love in the heart of Jesus
reached first to a few close friends, then to sinners
and outcasts, then to the Samaritans and the Gentiles,
and finally to the whole world. It led ultimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
to that most unselfish of all human enterprises—the
missionary movement.</p>

<p>Love leads to humility and self-sacrifice. Alms-giving
is done in private, not for social plaudits.
The individual prays, not to be seen of men and
thereby to be accounted good.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-9" href="#Footnote_VIII-9" class="fnanchor">VIII-9</a> He who seeks to
save his life shall lose it; whoever loses his life for
the sake of the Kingdom shall save it. He who
stores up for himself the wealth of the world shall
lose himself. Salutations in the market places and
chief seats in the synagogues in themselves are unworthy.
The poor in spirit are blessed.</p>

<p>Love shuns positions of worldly power, lest they
be secured at the loss of one’s soul.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-10" href="#Footnote_VIII-10" class="fnanchor">VIII-10</a> The best
positions in life are not to be seized; they are obtained
through the exercise of love; they are bestowed
in recognition of merit and worth. He who
exalts himself will be abased; the humble will be
exalted.</p>

<p>Love creates true greatness. The members of
the society of perfect love are characterized by the
sincerity, purity, humility of little children.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-11" href="#Footnote_VIII-11" class="fnanchor">VIII-11</a> He
who serves most is greatest. The Kingdom of God
is an aristocracy, not of Might but of Service. The
Son of God came to serve, not to be served. For
the sake of those outside the Kingdom, Jesus sanctified
himself, sacrificing even his life in that cause.</p>

<p>Love makes the Golden Rule the best sociological
proposition in Hebrew and Jewish literature.
“Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
do ye even so to them.” In reply to a lawyer of the
Pharisees, Jesus enunciated a two-fold commandment,
the first part of which invoked complete love
to God; and the second part, to man. The love of
the individual for his fellow man as shown in both
attitude and deeds is the test of the love of the
individual for God. Love means service. Love
does not connote lip-service; neither does it mean
divided service. No one can serve two masters,
God and mammon.</p>

<p>Christian love implies definite and continued public
service. Social service is the test of entrance to
the Kingdom, and of the sincerity of the individual’s
religious profession.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-12" href="#Footnote_VIII-12" class="fnanchor">VIII-12</a> On the judgment
day those on the right hand will be blessed and
given life eternal, and to them the king of the judgment
will say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Naked and ye clothed me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the righteous, with surprise, will inquire
of the Lord of the judgment: When did we see
you hungry and feed you; or thirsty, and give you
drink? When did we see you a stranger and take
you in? Then the Lord of the judgment will answer
them that when they had served the weak and
poor and the heavy-laden on earth, they had been
serving him and thereby had proved their loyalty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
God and earned the rewards of everlasting life.
And those who fail to measure up to the social
service test, whether professing Christians or not,
will be turned away.</p>

<p>The importance and nature of religio-social service
is indicated by Jesus when he symbolizes the
giving of a cup of cold water in his name as a test
for receiving eternal life.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-13" href="#Footnote_VIII-13" class="fnanchor">VIII-13</a> He who has two coats
should give one to him who has none. The sharing
of food with those who have no food is commanded.
Give liberally; give all thou hast.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-14" href="#Footnote_VIII-14" class="fnanchor">VIII-14</a> It is
blessed to give under all circumstances. Material
riches are insignificant in value when compared
with spiritual wealth. To give the things of this
world is to receive the greater things of the spirit.
He is richest who gives most, both of material and
spiritual goods. As an expression of his love for
God, Jesus lived a life of social and human service.</p>

<p>Whenever Jesus mentioned the ten commandments—all
three synoptic writers agree on this
point—he omitted the four commandments of individual
import and repeated only the social rules,
or principles:</p>

<p>
(1) Thou shalt do no murder,<br />
(2) Thou shalt not commit adultery,<br />
(3) Thou shalt not steal,<br />
(4) Thou shalt not bear false witness,<br />
(5) Honor thy father and mother,<br />
(6) Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>After the fashion of the major social prophets,
Jesus cried out vehemently against social injustice.
He denounced the persons who devour widows’
houses, or who lay unnecessary economic burdens
upon their fellowmen.</p>

<p>Anti-social religion, above all things else, angered
Jesus. He wanted no followers who were practicing
social or political injustice. Cursed are those
persons who appear righteous, who make long
prayers, or who go about in long robes, but who
inwardly are hypocrites, are full of dead men’s
bones, of uncleanness, of extortion and excess.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-15" href="#Footnote_VIII-15" class="fnanchor">VIII-15</a>
The shedding of innocent blood is condemned. The
paying of money in order to expiate sin will avail
nothing. Such money is tainted; it is blood money.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-16" href="#missing" class="fnanchor">VIII-16</a></p>

<p>Anti-social and commercialized religion so angered
Jesus that, contrary to his customary attitudes
toward sinners, he committed violence on one
occasion against offenders. He overthrew the
tables of the money changers in the temple, and,
making a scourge of small cords, he drove out the
money changers. In so doing, he declared that the
worship of God should not be commercialized.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-17" href="#Footnote_VIII-17" class="fnanchor">VIII-17</a> He
would not have the house of worship turned into a
cultured den of thieves.</p>

<p>So furious were the scribes and the chief priests
because of the attack of Jesus upon anti-social
religious practices that they planned how they
might kill him.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-18" href="#Footnote_VIII-18" class="fnanchor">VIII-18</a> It appears that as a direct result
of the antagonism of Jesus to the anti-social practices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
of the religious, or temple, authorities and of
the other religious leaders the conspiracy against
Jesus finally brought about his death. Jesus went
about stirring up the common people in a democratic
movement against the autocratic, hypocritical,
anti-social religious leaders among the Jews.
He met his death while championing the needs of
the masses who were being exploited in the name
of religion.</p>

<p>Jesus was the highest type of social democrat.
The perfected social order which he foresaw is a
democracy, ruled by the principles of love and
service in the name of God. Furthermore, no one
shall be compelled to come into the Kingdom. The
good tidings shall be presented to all individuals,
but the liberty of the individual shall not be violated.
The principle of voluntary assent, not compulsion
or conscription, rules in recruiting for the
Kingdom. Moreover, within the Kingdom, compulsion
is unknown. Love sufficeth.</p>

<p>Jesus hated sin. To him, sin was anything which
overcomes love and which causes the individual or
society to disintegrate. Sin is that which defeats
or hinders the coming of the Kingdom of Love.
Sin breaks up or holds back the social process. Sin,
like love, is organic. Sin grows. An evil tree
brings forth evil fruit; grapes and figs are not
gathered from thorns or thistle-bearing plants.</p>

<p>Jesus forgave sinners; even social sinners. By
means of his imagination, he put himself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
place of the sinner and sought to understand the
causes of the sinning. As his mind filled with an
understanding of sin, his heart overflowed with pity
and forgiveness for the sinner. He sought primarily
to reclaim; he thought secondarily of punishment.
Even in the case of the adulterous woman,
he sought to save what was left of the broken spirit
rather than to punish. His cardinal penological
principle was reformation.</p>

<p>It is significant that the social institution which
Jesus supported above all others, even above the
church and the state, was the family. Jesus spoke
frequently for the family. He commanded that
children should unwaveringly act loyally toward
parents; he used not only the clear-cut terms of the
writer of Exodus but added a curse of death upon
those who abuse their parents.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-19" href="#Footnote_VIII-19" class="fnanchor">VIII-19</a></p>

<p>An even stronger command was given by Jesus
concerning loyalty to the marriage relation. A
man’s genuine loyalty to his parents, undiminished
in intensity, must be subordinated to faithfulness
to his wife.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-20" href="#Footnote_VIII-20" class="fnanchor">VIII-20</a> This social theory is opposite in character
to that of Confucius concerning attitudes
toward parents and wives. The conception which
Jesus urged leads to social progress, while the
teaching of Confucius leads to social stagnation.</p>

<p>A man and woman who have been spiritually
joined together in wedlock are one flesh, above and
beyond separation by civil authorities. Jesus uttered
the stern and awe-inspiring sanction: What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder. The family as an institution is accorded
a sacredly fundamental place in the social order.</p>

<p>Jesus recognized woman as equal with man spiritually.
His attitude toward his mother and the
other women of his day was one of respect, chivalry,
and gentleness. He laid the foundations of a
social process in which women function on terms
of equality with men.</p>

<p>Honor to parents and honor to wife must be supplanted
by honor to children. Jesus worshiped
little children. In them he saw the innocence and
purity of God. When he wished to describe the
attributes of the Kingdom, he selected a little child
and held him up as typifying the simple, natural
spirit of perfect living. Although without children
himself, Jesus loved little children, choosing them
for special honors, and declaring that of such is
the Kingdom of God. It is not God’s will that one
of these little ones should perish; it is the stupidity
of man and the lack of social conscience that causes
a high mortality rate of little children. He who
harms the trustful child shall be cursed. It were
better for such a miscreant that a millstone were
tied about his neck and that he were thrown into
the sea.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-21" href="#Footnote_VIII-21" class="fnanchor">VIII-21</a></p>

<p>In regard to the influence of private property
Jesus was fearful. His zeal for and whole-hearted
loyalty to spiritual values made him suspicious of
vested interests. He repeatedly warned in vigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
language against the lure of gold and the baneful
influences of material wealth upon the attitudes and
acts of the individual. He himself showed no interest
in owning property. He lived without a
home of his own and without private means. If
he had possessed these, his life-work probably
would have failed. He urged his disciples to remain
free from the desire for money; he even commanded
them to rely for the means of material
subsistence upon the people with whom they labored.
Jesus believed that private property hindered
the realization of the principle of brotherhood
of man. He made a sharp distinction between the
interests of God and mammon. He believed that
these two sets of interests are diametrically opposed
to each other. To the extent that the individual
relies upon property, he separates himself
from God and the things of the Spirit. The disciples
were instructed to scorn, not only the earning
of wealth, but if they possessed earthly goods,
they were to sell these and give the proceeds to the
poor.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-22" href="#Footnote_VIII-22" class="fnanchor">VIII-22</a> The disciple of the spiritual life must
divorce himself from the love of monetary gain.</p>

<p>Toward the poor, Jesus was sympathetic. The
Gospel shall be preached chiefly to the poor, not
because the poor, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, need it more than the rich
and not because the poor should be specially favored,
but because they recognize their needs.
They are in a receptive attitude whereas the attitude
of the rich has been calloused by their wealth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
The response to the Gospel is not likely to be whole-hearted
by persons who possess an extensive interest
in riches.</p>

<p>Jesus taught a spiritual socialism. He thought
in terms of spiritual love for all persons, not of
material well-being for the proletariat. But he
seemed to prefer the company of the poor. Blessed
are the poor, was his attitude; for they are in a
frame of mind which makes them fit subjects for
the perfect Kingdom. The possession of property
gives the individual a feeling of self-exaltation;
poverty gives rise to humility—a cardinal virtue of
the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Jesus did not attack poverty with preventive
measures. Poverty will continue to exist.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-23" href="#Footnote_VIII-23" class="fnanchor">VIII-23</a> Perhaps
it is well that it should continue, for a nation
of economically satisfied people might not be religiously
minded. It is harder for a camel to go
through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get
into the swing of an untrammeled social process.
Woe unto the rich, because they are self-centered,
materially inclined, and pleasure-loving. The man
who pulled down his barns in order to build larger
barns, saying to himself, “Take thine ease, eat,
drink, and be merry,” is scathingly condemned by
Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-24" href="#Footnote_VIII-24" class="fnanchor">VIII-24</a> He is ostracized from the ideal society.
In the story of Lazarus and the rich man, the
former is carried to Abraham’s bosom, but the latter,
in torments, begs for a cup of water and the
company of Lazarus. He wanted Lazarus sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
him; he longed for the company of him whom he
once ignored. The attention of Jesus was continually
centered on the dangers of wealth, but rarely
on the need of preventing poverty.</p>

<p>Zaccheus, a rich man, was called as a disciple of
Jesus. But before the discipleship began, the superintendent
not only had to come down from the
mulberry tree and declare his allegiance to God,
but he had to become socially converted as well.
He promised to give one-half of his wealth to the
poor and to restore falsely acquired possessions
fourfold.</p>

<p>Then there was the rich young man who came
to Jesus, asking how he might obtain admittance
to the Kingdom, declaring that he observed the
commandments. One more thing, however, was
required of him, namely, that he sell all his possessions
and give the returns to the poor. Only by
so giving might he have treasure in the social
Kingdom.</p>

<p>The teaching of Jesus concerning the Sabbath
throws light on the exceedingly human element in
his thought. The Sabbath is a special day for doing
good deeds.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-25" href="#Footnote_VIII-25" class="fnanchor">VIII-25</a> The Sabbath is to be treated not primarily
from the standpoint of religious rites but
from the viewpoint of human welfare. Works of
necessity, and deeds of mercy and kindness to man
and beast are proper to the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-26" href="#Footnote_VIII-26" class="fnanchor">VIII-26</a> Man was
not made for the Sabbath, but the day of rest and
good deeds was designed for the benefit of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>The attitude of Jesus toward the problem of
peace versus war has aroused considerable controversy.
There are certain of his sayings which seem
to contradict each other. But an analysis of all his
teachings demonstrates that his emphasis was on
peace. The exceptions to the rule will be stated
first.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-27" href="#Footnote_VIII-27" class="fnanchor">VIII-27</a> On one occasion he said: I came not to
send peace, but a sword. The context shows that
Jesus was speaking in an individual and not a
national way. He had in mind the conflicts which
arise between the individuals who are converted to
the ideals of the Kingdom and those who are not.
Jesus explained that those who love him must do
so even at the expense of forsaking father and
mother.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-28" href="#Footnote_VIII-28" class="fnanchor">VIII-28</a> Loyalty to the Kingdom may mean that
the son will oppose the practices of his father in
business, the daughter will object to the time wasted
in the unChristian practices of her mother, the
parents will protest the sowing of “wild oats” by
son or daughter.</p>

<p>In the temple, on one occasion, Jesus displayed
anger and used violence. He was dealing, however,
with a group of criminals, cultured criminals,
who apparently would respond to no treatment except
violence. They would not cease their nefarious
practices except through compulsion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the illustrations are many
where Jesus used love in order to change the ways
of people. He never used force in his own behalf,
even to save his life. He rebuked Simon Peter for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
drawing his sword and cutting off the right ear of
the servant of the high priest who in company with
others were seeking Jesus in order to bind him and
kill him.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-29" href="#Footnote_VIII-29" class="fnanchor">VIII-29</a> At another time Jesus specifically enjoined:
Resist not evil; and instructed his followers
when smitten upon the right cheek to turn
the left also. Those who take the sword shall perish
by the sword; the nation that builds itself up
by the sword shall be destroyed by it.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-30" href="#Footnote_VIII-30" class="fnanchor">VIII-30</a></p>

<p>The birth of Jesus was accompanied by glad tidings
and song, proclaiming peace on earth and good
will toward men.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-31" href="#Footnote_VIII-31" class="fnanchor">VIII-31</a> Blessed are the peacemakers.
In the perfect society, good will by all to all will be
shown, perfect love will reign, and permanent peace
will prevail.</p>

<p>Jesus may or may not have expressed himself on
several important issues of his day. The incomplete
records do not indicate his attitude upon many
vital social problems. It appears that Jesus usually
spoke in remedial rather than preventive social
terms. However, beneath this remedial terminology
there are fundamental social principles,
which, if put into common practice, would solve all
social problems. Jesus proposed to build an ideal
society by re-making and regenerating individuals.
He dared to promulgate the radical program of re-making
human nature itself. He commanded that
all selfish impulses and instincts be completely subordinated
to the altruistic and socializing desires.</p>

<p>Jesus insisted throughout his life-work upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
principle that material factors must be subjected to
spiritual values. In order to make this principle
clear he often took particular pains to treat material
goods with the utmost insignificance. He
perceived that individuals are made slaves by the
worship of wealth, either on the part of themselves,
of the privileged classes, or of society itself. He
inaugurated a program of spiritualization which
would free the world from the slavery which may
come from economic forces.</p>

<p>Although a religious teacher above all things else,
Jesus insisted upon the necessity of the existence
of something more than saving faith alone. He
required a social attitude of mind, a heart of social
love, and a spirit of service. Give freely to others.
Serve others. By giving himself for others, the
individual will function in the Kingdom of perfect
love, and win other individuals to that Kingdom.</p>

<p>Jesus required that love be substituted for hate.
Unkind deeds must be supplanted by kind deeds.
According to this principle, employers and employees
must learn to love one another; and business
must be put upon the basis of love and service.
Government must be a series of mutual services.
Religion must harbor no selfishness. In all human
relationships, Jesus reiterated the principle: Love,
love, love. This is the spiritualizing and socializing
principle by which Jesus proposed to make over the
social process.</p>

<p>Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, by virtue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
unique experiences and many travels, possessed a
cosmopolitan attitude of mind. He gave a practical
application of the teaching of Jesus concerning
the brotherhood of man. He urged the equal
treatment of Jews and Gentiles, bond and free.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-32" href="#Footnote_VIII-32" class="fnanchor">VIII-32</a>
He preached the essential unity of mankind. God
is no respecter of persons; his Kingdom is a spiritual
democracy. We are all—Jew and Gentile—children
of the same Father, who gave his son in
service for all.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-33" href="#Footnote_VIII-33" class="fnanchor">VIII-33</a> To the call to come over into
Macedonia for the purpose of rendering aid, Paul
responded immediately and favorably. By so doing
he believed that he was carrying out the true implications
of the love of God.</p>

<p>The greatest tribute that has ever been paid to
love as a social force was given by Paul.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-34" href="#Footnote_VIII-34" class="fnanchor">VIII-34</a> Although
possessing the highest educational qualifications
and being able to speak with the greatest eloquence,
any individual leads a practically useless
life unless that life is motivated by love. Giving
one’s possessions to the poor and sacrificing one’s
body counts little if one does these things in any
other spirit than that of love. Love protects the
individual from envying his neighbors, from becoming
proud and haughty and boastful. Love is
the greatest principle of life.</p>

<p>The members of the Kingdom of God should
love one another under all circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-35" href="#Footnote_VIII-35" class="fnanchor">VIII-35</a> They
should bear one another’s burdens.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-36" href="#Footnote_VIII-36" class="fnanchor">VIII-36</a> They should
do good to all men, even to those who persecute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Above all, they should not recompense any man
with evil for evil, or fail to feed their enemies if
the latter hunger. Love is the law of God. Perfect
love is more powerful than principalities and powers
and even death.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-37" href="#Footnote_VIII-37" class="fnanchor">VIII-37</a> Love conquers all evil. Love
is more powerful than might. A practical, cosmopolitan
brotherhood of man is one of the fundamental
concepts of Paul’s teachings.</p>

<p>Paul taught the organic unity of mankind. In
the perfect Christian order each individual has a
specific function to perform which is a part of the
whole process. Paul compares this situation to the
human body in which there are many organs, each
performing its individual but correlated function.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-38" href="#Footnote_VIII-38" class="fnanchor">VIII-38</a>
No one liveth to himself, no one dieth to himself.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-39" href="#Footnote_VIII-39" class="fnanchor">VIII-39</a>
Every individual, even in dying, influences the social
equilibrium and affects group progress. All
individuals in the perfect Kingdom are co-laborers
and co-operators. Whatever weakens one individual
weakens society; whatever strengthens the
individual strengthens society, providing that
strength is used societarily.</p>

<p>Another fundamental element in the social
thought of Paul was his concept of sin. Sin is socially
and individually destructive. The wages of
sin—a generic term—is death. Paul made a long
list of social sins, namely: covetousness, maliciousness,
drunkenness, wantonness, dishonesty, fraud,
stealing, fornication, murder. In nearly all his letters,
Paul warned his followers against the evils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
which beset mankind. He urged people to beware
of the appearance of doing evil. Paul’s rule of
conduct was the Aristotelian mean: Be temperate
in all things.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Paul cited long lists of virtues.
Love is continually urged. Temperance,
meekness, gentleness, honesty, purity, and justice
are repeatedly stressed. Paul’s description of a
good man and bishop is the delineation of the character
of a social citizen, who is temperate, a good
husband, who is not mercenary nor covetous, and
who ruleth well his household, with good reputation
and character.</p>

<p>In all Paul’s thought, righteous living was uppermost.
Cheerful giving was commended. The
strong should bear the infirmities of the weak, not
only for the sake of the weak, but in order that the
strong may not become self-centered.</p>

<p>Paul taught a gospel of peace. He deprecated
strife between individuals. He trusted in the operation
of the law of love. Love will bring order out
of confusion, and peace out of discord. The social
Kingdom of God, motivated by love, moves orderly,
harmoniously, and constructively.</p>

<p>Paul firmly supported the family as an essential
institution of society. He admonished children to
obey their parents, to honor their fathers and
mothers. He commanded wives to obey their husbands,
and husbands to love their wives even as
Christ loved the church and as men love themselves.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-40" href="#Footnote_VIII-40" class="fnanchor">VIII-40</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
He commanded men to remain true in the
marriage relation, and to keep the single standard
of morals inviolate.</p>

<p>The dangers of wealth were frequently pointed
out by Paul. We brought no riches into this life:
we can not take any riches out. Riches continually
subject us to temptations, snares, and lusts. The
love of money is the root of all evil.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-41" href="#Footnote_VIII-41" class="fnanchor">VIII-41</a> The greatest
wealth which any person can acquire is the wealth
of good deeds done to other persons.</p>

<p>The thought of Paul concerning law is exceedingly
modern. Law is not for the righteous; law
is for the lawless and disobedient. The honest and
righteous and just are above the law in the sense
that a well-mated husband and wife are above the
law of divorce. If there were none other than
happily-mated husbands and wives, there would be
no need of divorce laws. In a similar way, if perfect
love prevailed among all people, law could be
entirely discarded. The teachings of Paul run the
gamut of brotherly love. Paul thought in terms of
concepts such as these: being well-grounded in love;
abounding in love; let brotherly love continue;
the love of Christ constraineth. Paul carried a
message of love to all men, and established the
church as a home for all who would accept Christ’s
message of love.</p>

<p>The apostle James spoke in no uncertain terms of
the democracy of God, the need of helping the weak,
the dangers of riches, the evils of strife, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
social commandments. James made social service
a fundamental test of religion.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-42" href="#Footnote_VIII-42" class="fnanchor">VIII-42</a></p>

<p>Peter attacked the same social sins that Jesus
and Paul had flayed, argued in behalf of the justice
of God, and proclaimed with new vigor the law of
love.</p>

<p>John is the chief exponent of the principle of
love. God is love. The reign of God is a reign of
love; the Kingdom of God is a Kingdom of perfect
love. In the Book of Revelation, John describes
two cities; one wicked; and the other, perfect. The
first is elegantly clothed in purple and gold, bedecked
with precious stones. But her heart is rotten.
Lust and vice have ruined her. Her dominating
sins are sex immorality and luxury. The
perfect city is the new Jerusalem, a community of
happy people, motivated in all things by love.
Nothing that defileth is permitted in the New
Jerusalem, nor anything that worketh abomination,
or maketh a lie.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-43" href="#Footnote_VIII-43" class="fnanchor">VIII-43</a></p>

<p>The fundamentals of early Christian social
thought may now be summarized. The New Testament
authorities offered no system of sociology;
they did not submit a scientific program for the
social reorganization of the world, but made, however,
substantial contributions.</p>

<p>(1) Early Christian social thought represented
a system of changing the attitudes of individuals.
By making over individuals the world can be improved.
The individual is exalted. The individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
must be re-educated. The right sort of men will
produce the right sort of social structure and the
proper type of social process and society. Christianity
indicated socialized principles of conduct
which the disciples of Christianity must accept.</p>

<p>(2) The Fatherhood of God is made a cardinal
principle of the Kingdom. When all persons recognize
the Fatherhood of God, they will have a strong
tie binding them together and impelling them to
regenerated living.</p>

<p>(3) The universal brotherhood of man is a
natural corollary of the principle of the Fatherhood
of God. When everyone recognizes the underlying
brotherhood of all individuals, the prejudices of
race which now so bitterly divide mankind will begin
to dissolve.</p>

<p>(4) Marriage is a divine right, and husbands
and wives shall work together in behalf of their
children. The family is the chief social institution
which the New Testament writers supported.</p>

<p>(5) Little children set examples of simple faith
and trust. They call for sacrifice and transform
parents into altruistic beings.</p>

<p>(6) Early Christian thought was missionary.
It was not self-centered. It said: Go. It drove out
its adherents unto all forms of unselfish living. It
required that its followers help the sick, preach the
gospel, travel into foreign lands. It was an activity
religion. It defined in living terms the dynamic and
driving principle of love.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Social Thought in the Middle Ages</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The social thought of the Middle Ages was in
part a reflection of the unsettled social conditions,
and in part an outgrowth of the thought and life
of the five centuries which intervened between the
beginning of the Christian Era and the Fall of
Rome. During these centuries the Church Fathers
moved away from the pristine Christian teachings.
While they accepted the underlying social nature of
mankind and believed that government and social
organization were necessary in order to curb evil
tendencies, their teachings treated government as a
divine institution and transformed rulers into
super-powerful beings with divine rights. The
autocratic rather than the democratic element in
government received support.</p>

<p>The strong Roman bias for organization and
administration was builded into the church—the
result was the powerful Church of Rome with its
hierarchal structure. After the Fall of Rome, the
Roman proclivity for centralization of government
lived on and produced within the Church a center
of power that has been the marvel of church
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>The Church Fathers directed the attention of the
people to the next world and to preparation therefor.
Sacramental and sacrificial methods of salvation
were elaborated. The importance of improving
social conditions was ignored. In fact, the injustices
in the current social order were considered
as disciplinary measures for the soul in its preparation
for the next world. The improvement of living
conditions was considered to be wasted effort,
if not indicative of heretical tendencies of mind.</p>

<p>By the third century, loyalty to creed had become
a dominant note in Christianity. The poor constituted
a decreasing influence in church life; wealth
was exerting unChristian influences. The aristocratic
elements in church organization began to
transform the poor into a special class within the
church. Poverty was not viewed preventively. By
the time of the Fall of Rome the poor had become
objects upon which to bestow alms as a means of
expiating sin.</p>

<p>The greatest of the Latin Fathers was Saint
Augustine (354–450). Among other works, he
wrote a large set of twenty-two volumes under the
title of <i>The City of God</i>. In this gigantic undertaking
social thought was submerged beneath theological
discussions. A part of the argument is devoted
to an explanation of the Fall of Rome. The
leading causal elements are described as economic
factors, such as the rise of luxury; and religious
unbelief, such as the worship of pagan gods. Augustine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
describes two cities, one of this world, materialistic
and debasing; and one of the next world—the
City of God, which through the will of God
will finally triumph.</p>

<p>During the first half of the Middle Ages the
dominant tendencies are Roman and Christian.
The Roman power of organization gains increasing
strength in its new form—the Church. The Christian
influences were expressed in high ideals, new
duties, and asceticism. The church acted as a
soothing and quieting force in the centuries of unrest.
It built elaborate monasteries and gathered
together under its protecting wing large numbers
of people, chiefly the poor. Under the supervision
of the church, these religious believers lived in communal
and sympathetic fashion. Along with these
developments the church also manifested grave
abuses. At the expense sometimes of the ignorant
and the poor the church grew powerful.</p>

<p>Out of the period of social disorder which characterized
the early Middle Ages there developed
educational movements, such as that which Charlemagne
sponsored, and the system of Feudalism,
which gave to the Middle Ages its most distinctive
set of characteristics. Feudalism made land the
central institution of society. The ownership of
land gave power; land constituted social and political
power. Land was parcelled out upon the receipt
of oaths of homage and fealty. Under this
land system there were three classes of people: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
nobles, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobles
were the rulers and exercised military prerogatives.
The clergy were either the privileged subjects of
the nobles, or else through the institution which
they represented they acquired land power. The
peasants often despised the nobles, although they
worked for and supported them.</p>

<p>As an outgrowth of feudal industry various
forms of guilds or industrial organizations flourished
from the tenth to the fifteenth centuries.
Sometimes the masters and workmen jointly belonged
to guilds, as in the case of the merchant
guilds. Sometimes the guilds became local monopolies.
Always they possessed the aim of improving
the conditions of the membership.</p>

<p>The religious wars, or Crusades, of the eleventh
to the thirteenth centuries inaugurated many
changes. They gave the restless nobility major
themes of attention and even removed many nobles
through death in battle from the European arena.
They created intellectual unrest. They enlarged
the horizons of many individuals and gave rise to
skepticism. They led to the Reformation.</p>

<p>Social thought in the Middle Ages received a
considerable stimulus from Teutonic sources. The
barbarous Teutons contributed ideas of freedom.
They increased the emphasis upon the individual.
They were rough, bold exponents of “personal liberty,”
and disregarded mere churchly procedure,
social traditions, and some of the finer ideals of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
and character. On the other hand, chivalry and
knighthood were perhaps of Teutonic origin.</p>

<p>The church utilized chivalry. It became the
duty of the knight to defend the church and that
which belonged to the church. Chivalry became a
form of social discipline which ruled in the latter
part of the Middle Ages. It softened manners and
became the sponsor for virtue. It remained, however,
a modified military structure with military
traditions.</p>

<p>The rise of scholasticism took place in opposition
to monasticism. In the ninth century the leading
thinkers had not advanced beyond the conception
of a natural social state, characterized by
chaotic conditions, and organized by political machinery.
By the twelfth century only the faintest
glimmerings of a doctrine of popular sovereignty
had begun to appear. The thought of the day was
largely theological.</p>

<p>The church through its systems of monasteries
had maintained centers where religious and intellectual
traditions had been preserved. These centers
were undoubtedly important factors in conserving
much that was valuable in an age when ruthless
disregard for civilized values prevailed.</p>

<p>Because of the abuses which sprang up in connection
with the monasteries, certain positive reactions
against the monasteries arose. St. Francis of
Assisi (1181–1226) turned from the monastery to
actual life. He inaugurated a method for the regeneration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
of society. He and his followers lived
and spent themselves among the actual poor, subjecting
themselves to the economic conditions of
the poor. They helped the poor, not by giving alms
as an expiation for sin and to secure self-salvation,
but by the first-hand giving of their lives. St.
Francis ignored the regular ecclesiastical conception
of charity and gave it all the reality of a new and
genuine social force. By renouncing the possession
of property and living as the poor live, he obtained
what he could secure in no other way—the poor
man’s point of view. In this way, also, he secured
an entrance into the poor man’s mind and heart
that could not be had so well by any other method.
By renouncing wealth and accepting literal poverty
he reached the core of the problem of poverty. St.
Francis was motivated by a desire to live a life of
love. He spent not wealth but his life for the poor.</p>

<p>Scholasticism developed as a reaction against
churchly asceticism. According to scholasticism
the individual should look to reason rather than to
church dogma for religious and spiritual guidance.
Scholasticism repudiated church traditions as a
guide for individual action; it turned to Aristotelian
logic for its technique. Thomas Aquinas
(1226–1274), the best known of the scholastic
philosophers, pushed forward the Aristotelian
premises as follows: Man is a social being: he
unites with other individuals in a social organization
in order to gain his own purposes. The individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
looks to able rulers for wise political guidance;
he accords the requisite power to these rulers.
Aquinas thus recognized a tacit social compact, or
contract, foreshadowing Rousseau.</p>

<p>In religion, scholasticism reduced religious mysticism
to rational forms. It based religion on
learning rather than on authority; it pursued the
methods of reasoning rather than of contemplation.</p>

<p>Scholasticism furthered the advancement of
learning; it aided and developed the life of the
universities. It encouraged the growth of independent
thinking, although its decline set in about
the fourteenth century, before it had had a fair
opportunity to inaugurate a movement which would
lead to an inductive or a positivistic philosophy, or
sociology.</p>

<p>Various other thought elements appeared in the
closing centuries of the Middle Ages. As early as
the ninth century a maritime code, a military code,
and a rural code were formulated in the Byzantine
Empire in order to meet new social needs. Until
the fall of Constantinople the Byzantine influence
was a deterrent against the forces from the East.
Byzantium preserved and gave a new impetus to
Grecian literature, art, architecture, and law.</p>

<p>In Arabia the celebrated historian and philosopher
Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), made a detailed
and surprisingly accurate description of the social
life of the Arab tribes. With the evolution of the
life of the individual, he compared the development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
of the successive stages in social life. This distinguished
historian urged that history should consider
not simply rulers, dynasties, and wars, but also
racial factors, climatic forces, the laws of association,
and the stages of associative life. He wished
to make history scientific, even a social science. He
formulated an evolutionary doctrine of social progress.
He evolved a spiral theory of social evolution,
beginning with the crudest primitive life and
ending with the most civilized urban life.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the fourteenth century, England’s
great popular poet, William Langland, wrote
an allegorical poem entitled, <i>Piers Ploughman</i>.
In this work the oppressed laboring and peasant
classes cry aloud their longings for improved conditions.
They are personified in Piers the Ploughman,
who as a dignified laborer, plays for the
first time the leading rôle in serious thought. He
is the leader of a field of all types of people who
are laboring together and longing for a better social
order. Along with the agricultural laborers we
see weavers and tailors, friars and minstrels, merchants
and knights. Labor of every sort is dignified.
All living laborers who work with their hands
and minds, truly earning, living in love and according
to the laws of social order and progress, will
become the pure and perfected leaders of truth.</p>

<p>Langland depicted well the living and working
conditions of the English laboring classes. Productive
toil, he argued, will receive its crown of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
glory. But he did not indicate practical solutions.
Langland was sure, however, that the service of
labor to society is sacred. He pronounced patient
poverty to be the prince of all virtues. He personified
Jesus in the form of a working man. Langland’s
fourteenth century social message was that
the individual should renounce wealth, join the
honest laboring poor, and follow Christ’s example
of living a life of labor and love.<a id="FNanchor_IX-1" href="#Footnote_IX-1" class="fnanchor">IX-1</a></p>

<p>Social thought in the Middle Ages is fragmentary.
While several centuries are included in
the period, new social ideas are very few. The centuries
of unrest and transition, the paucity of great
leaders, the intellectual stagnation, and the prevalent
illiteracy of the masses produced situations in
which little social thinking of importance was stimulated.
New thought of any type was almost negligible
except as an isolated individual stood forth,
such as Augustine, Charlemagne, Ibn Khaldun,
Aquinas. A portion of the social thinking of the
preceding age, however, was preserved, constituting
a foundation for the renaissance of social thought
that was coming.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">More and Utopian Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the close of Middle Ages with its
modicum of social thinking, the idealism of Plato
appeared in a new form, namely, in descriptive
utopias. Of these, the chief and subtlest was the
work of England’s sane, shrewd, tolerant student
of society, Sir Thomas More (1478–1535). More’s
<i>Utopia</i> deserves a degree of attention which is not
customarily accorded it.</p>

<p>More mediated Plato to modern social philosophy;
he moved in the field of Platonic ideas and
ideals. He was also indebted to Plutarch’s account
of Spartan life. At the dawn of the Renaissance
he presented the concept of a perfect commonwealth.</p>

<p>If one would understand the social thought of
More, a contemporary of Columbus, he must put
himself under the spell of fifteenth and sixteenth
century conditions in England. He must remind
himself of Henry VII and Henry VIII, two autocratic
rulers whom it was difficult for any individually-minded
person to please. The living conditions
of the peasants were almost intolerable. Unemployment
was common. Punishments were severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and brutalizing. Even thieves were subject
to capital punishment. If an individual stole a loaf
of bread, he might as well kill the person who saw
him steal the bread. In fact, by so doing, he might
be better off—the only witness to his theft would
thus be unable to testify against him.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More could not have openly criticised
the unjust social conditions of his day, and
long escaped death. It was necessary for him to
put his radical ideas into the mouth of a fictitious
traveler, Raphael Hythloday, and thereby disown
them. At is was, More became a martyr to his
religious faith and to the cause of social freedom.</p>

<p>More wrote the <i>Utopia</i> in two parts. Part one
was written as an explanation, or introduction, to
part two. In part one a conversation involving
three persons is reported. A conservative Dutch
citizen of Antwerp converses with Raphael Hythloday,
an experienced traveler, and with More.
Hythloday, however, is the chief speaker. He is
well versed in Latin and especially in Greek culture.
Moreover, he has traveled extensively, even with
Amerigo Vespucci, the Florentine navigator. In
this way he is given prestige in the mind of the
reader. It is not impossible in part one of <i>Utopia</i>
to recognize a distinct resemblance to the dialogue
form of Plato.</p>

<p>Part one describes certain factors in the political
situation in England. The untoward phases of
poverty and the vicious forms of punishment that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
prevailed are painted in gloomy colors. The reader
is glad to turn from this unpleasant social picture
to the description in part two of <i>Utopia</i>, where the
people are living under well-ordered conditions.</p>

<p>The ideal commonwealth is located on the mystical
island of Amaurote, where Raphael Hythloday
lived for five years. On this island the economic
and social life is communistic, somewhat
after the manner of Plato’s <i>Republic</i>. It is a fundamental
communism which More postulates. Complete
communism of goods exists on Amaurote.<a id="FNanchor_X-1" href="#Footnote_X-1" class="fnanchor">X-1</a>
All possess equal portions of wealth. The Utopian
communistic state implies a radical change in human
nature. More justifies communism on the
grounds that it roots out that serious social evil,
covetousness.<a id="FNanchor_X-2" href="#Footnote_X-2" class="fnanchor">X-2</a> Likewise, the incentive for stealing
and plundering is removed. If there is a scarcity
of economic commodities in any part of Utopia, the
surplus in any other part is immediately drawn
upon to meet the need. Thus the whole land conducts
itself as if it were one family or household.<a id="FNanchor_X-3" href="#Footnote_X-3" class="fnanchor">X-3</a>
The guiding principle in regard to economic goods
is that of human needs.</p>

<p>In Utopia everyone finds his greatest pleasure
in giving to others. The strongest league of peoples
or of nations is not that which is united chiefly
by covenants or treaties, but one which is knit together
by love and a benevolent attitude.<a id="FNanchor_X-4" href="#Footnote_X-4" class="fnanchor">X-4</a> The
strongest league in the world is that which is based
on the fellowship of kindred natures—a genuine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Christian brotherhood of nations.</p>

<p>In Utopia, agriculture is the most highly respected
occupation. Agriculture is a science in
which all Utopian men and women are expert. In
the harvest days the urban people, both men and
women (farmerettes) go out into the country and
help gather in the crops.<a id="FNanchor_X-5" href="#Footnote_X-5" class="fnanchor">X-5</a> Urban and rural co-operation
at harvest time solves the farmer’s employment
problems to the pleasure, good feeling,
and advantage of all concerned. The food question
is considered of paramount national importance.
The agriculturist is equipped with the best
tools and follows intensive methods.<a id="FNanchor_X-6" href="#Footnote_X-6" class="fnanchor">X-6</a></p>

<p>In addition to agricultural science, every citizen
of Utopia learns at least one trade or craft.<a id="FNanchor_X-7" href="#Footnote_X-7" class="fnanchor">X-7</a> Even
every woman learns a skilled trade. The advantages
of learning a trade by every citizen are obvious—they
include a great increase in the potential
industrial resources of a people. The question
may be raised here, if it would not be a worth-while
asset for every citizen in our modern days to learn
a trade. Such an accomplishment would give a
sense of economic independence to every individual;
it would afford to everyone the point of view
of the skilled workman; it would add a gigantic
potential force to production.</p>

<p>In Utopia, there is one leader, or syphogrant, to
every thirty families. Although there are other
officers, including a prince for each city and a king
for the island, the syphogrants are in reality the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
leading officials. It is noteworthy that no public
matters are to be decided until they have been considered
and debated for at least three days. By
this scientific procedure the necessity of rescinding
hasty legislative action is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>An important duty of the syphogrants is to
regulate employment. Not only is everyone in
Utopia to have a trade, but all are to work. There
are no idle poor or idle rich. All rich men, commonly
called “gentlemen,” all women, priests,
monks, and friars (except a few) engage in productive
labor. Even the syphogrants, or officials,
work spontaneously. All useless occupations are
prohibited. In countries where the dollar rules,
there are many vain occupations which serve only
to augment riotous superfluities.<a id="FNanchor_X-8" href="#Footnote_X-8" class="fnanchor">X-8</a> Thus, since all
persons work and since only needed occupations
are permitted in Utopia, the working day is shortened
to six hours.</p>

<p>In the case of a season of unemployment, the
simple device is adopted of shortening temporarily
the labor day. By cutting down the hours of labor
to four a day during an unemployment period,
work is provided for all. When an individual, it
may be added, visits his friends, he works the same
as if he were at home. He sets himself to the task
in which his friends are engaged. No one in
Utopia is encumbered with visitors who sit about
doing nothing and at the same time hinder their
hosts from productive activities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>The syphogrants prevent idleness; they also prevent
overwork. They permit no one to work at a
task like a laboring and toiling beast; they allow
no one to become a slave to his labor.</p>

<p>Laws in Utopia are few in number. Inasmuch
as all the people are well instructed and socially
minded, many laws are needless.<a id="FNanchor_X-9" href="#Footnote_X-9" class="fnanchor">X-9</a> Each citizen is
above the law in the same way that an honest person
is above the law against stealing. In the case
of those disputes which must necessarily arise, the
plaintiff and defendant go before the judge and
plead for themselves. Utopia is noted for its
scarcity of laws and the absence of attorneys. No
crafty and subtle interpretation of laws by attorneys
is permitted. Every man is his own attorney
and simply states the facts in the given dispute; the
judge knows the law and decides the case.</p>

<p>The organization of the cities is interesting. In
the middle of each quarter of each city there is a
market place for the exchange of all manner of
goods. Public <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">abattoirs</i> are in operation. Splendidly
appointed hospitals are located outside the
cities in a quiet environment. Contagious wards
are provided. So excellent is the care which is afforded
the patients in the public hospitals that any
person who falls sick prefers to go to a hospital
than to be cared for by the kindly ministrations of
relatives at home. It may be noted that every city
is provided with a hall of fame.</p>

<p>Every urban community is a garden city; every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
house has a garden plot. Furthermore, the people
take much pride in their gardens; they compete with
one another, endeavoring to excel in the fruitage
and in the beauty of the gardens.<a id="FNanchor_X-10" href="#Footnote_X-10" class="fnanchor">X-10</a></p>

<p>City planning rules in Utopia.<a id="FNanchor_X-11" href="#Footnote_X-11" class="fnanchor">X-11</a> Overcrowding
is not permitted; whenever a city exceeds the norm,
a new city is established. New urban communities
are established by public action.</p>

<p>Social centers are common on the island of
Amaurote. In the winter when the people cannot
work in their gardens after the supper hour, they
gather in their community halls, where they engage
in music, wholesome conversation, and games.
Dice-play and similar foolish and pernicious games
are unknown.<a id="FNanchor_X-12" href="#Footnote_X-12" class="fnanchor">X-12</a> Wine taverns, alehouses, “stewes,”
lurking corners, and places of wicked counsels are
prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_X-13" href="#Footnote_X-13" class="fnanchor">X-13</a></p>

<p>Good health is a virtue in Amaurote; great pleasure
is derived from possessing a well-ordered state
of public health. Health is considered a sovereign
pleasure in itself.<a id="FNanchor_X-14" href="#Footnote_X-14" class="fnanchor">X-14</a> Preventive measures are substituted
for remedial medicines.</p>

<p>Fashions are regulated rigidly. Fashion imitation
is prevented. The garments for men are all
of one mode; and for women, of another mode.<a id="FNanchor_X-15" href="#Footnote_X-15" class="fnanchor">X-15</a>
The married are distinguished from the unmarried
by the style of wearing apparel. Thus, there are
simply four sets of styles in Amaurote. Coats of
uniform colors—the natural color of wool—are
worn. It is argued that coats of many colors are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
no warmer and hence no more practical than coats
of the one natural color; they are more expensive
and hence more wasteful.</p>

<p>In Utopia, gold and silver are held in reproach.
They are not considered to be as useful as iron.
Consequently, the Utopians load down their slaves
with gold and silver ornaments and pearls.<a id="FNanchor_X-16" href="#Footnote_X-16" class="fnanchor">X-16</a> In
this connection the description of the visit of a
group of ambassadors to Amaurote is amusing.
The ambassadors from an adjoining country were
dressed in gorgeous apparel like the very gods.
They came to Amaurote wearing chains of gold
and displaying peacock feathers. The citizens of
Amaurote, coming out to meet the guests, rushed
past the ambassadors and saluted the plainly
dressed slaves of the ambassadors. They mistook
the ambassadors for fools and knaves. Even the
little children of Amaurote, when they saw the jewelry
of the ambassadors, looked at their mothers
and said: “See, how great a lubber doth wear
pearls and precious stones, as if he were still a little
child.”<a id="FNanchor_X-17" href="#Footnote_X-17" class="fnanchor">X-17</a> After being in Amaurote a short time,
the ambassadors perceived how foolish it was to
set emphasis on the doubtful glistenings of trifling
stones. They recognized that it is foolish to consider
oneself nobler than other selves because one
can wear clothes that are spun from finer wool than
the clothes of other persons. After all, whether the
wool is coarse or fine, it may have come from the
self-same sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>An individual does not become a god by wearing
precious stones. The more the individual burdens
himself with heavy stones and gorgeous apparel,
the more insignificant he is.</p>

<p>Although in Utopia no man is wealthy, yet in a
sense, all men are wealthy. All live joyfully, without
worrying, and without fearing that they or
their children will fall into poverty. Amaurote is
a gigantic household, wherein the more able take
a personal interest in the less able and in the unfortunate.
No one lives in idleness and no one
lives by virtue of any form of unnecessary economic
enterprise. Rich men are not permitted by either
private fraud or common law to snatch away from
the poor man some portion, great or small, of his
daily earnings. There are no idle rich, conniving
how they may keep their unearned wealth or how
they may grind down the poor in order to get more
wealth. Since the love of money is unknown in
Amaurote, other passions are also absent. Since
the people do not love money, they have lost the
desire to perpetrate the money crimes, such as
fraud, theft, murder, treason. Likewise, pride
which measures its satisfaction, not in terms of its
own merits, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, but by comparison with the poverty
of human beings, is destroyed. The Utopians
have conquered materialism. They are not subject
to the death grapples which are caused by the love
of money. Luxuries have been suppressed and the
leisure class has been eliminated. Social extremes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
are unknown.</p>

<p>People are honored, not for their wealth but for
their serviceableness to the community.<a id="FNanchor_X-18" href="#Footnote_X-18" class="fnanchor">X-18</a> In the
halls of fame, to which allusion has already been
made, benefactors of the commonwealth are rewarded
by having images of themselves set up in
perpetual memory of their good deeds to their
fellows.</p>

<p>The family is the fundamental social unit, but it
is of the patriarchal type. Pure monogamic love is
idealized. Especial care is taken that neither of the
parties of a marriage vow possesses any hidden
vices. Adultery is the chief justification for breaking
the marriage bond. A single standard of
morals for both husband and wife is set. Love
may be won by beauty, but it can be kept and preserved
only by virtue and obedience.</p>

<p>Because of freedom from long hours of monotonous
labor, nearly every one in Utopia is able to
maintain his intellectual interests and to experience
intellectual growth throughout life. It is the solemn
custom to have daily lectures early every morning
and it is the habit of multitudes of people of all
types to attend.<a id="FNanchor_X-19" href="#Footnote_X-19" class="fnanchor">X-19</a> All of the time that it is possible
to spare from the necessary occupations is devoted
to the development and garnishing of the mind.<a id="FNanchor_X-20" href="#Footnote_X-20" class="fnanchor">X-20</a>
Nearly all the citizens devote their extra-occupational
hours throughout their lives to the arts and
sciences. The chief felicity of life is said to be
found in learning. In training the mind, the Utopians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
never weary. As a matter of course, a common
school education is provided for every individual.
Classes for adults and adult education are
made the outstanding features of the public school
system in Amaurote. One must learn to live and
must go on learning throughout life. Hence, the
provisions of public education should be adequate
for the adult as well as for the adolescent.</p>

<p>Religious education and practice are considered
essential. More’s tolerant attitude in an age of
brutal intolerance is shown by the fact that the Utopians
are permitted whatever religion they prefer.
Superstitious beliefs are taboo. More makes a
subtle thrust when he observes that the priests of
Amaurote are possessed of great holiness and hence
are few in number.<a id="FNanchor_X-21" href="#Footnote_X-21" class="fnanchor">X-21</a> It is no esoteric or monastic
religion which More endorses. Future happiness
may be secured best by busy labors and social efforts
in this life.<a id="FNanchor_X-22" href="#Footnote_X-22" class="fnanchor">X-22</a> Public service, including the care of
the sick, is religiously emphasized.</p>

<p>War is beastly. Contrary to the attitudes of the
people in all other countries, the people of Amaurote
count nothing so inglorious as the glory that is
obtained in fighting and killing.<a id="FNanchor_X-23" href="#Footnote_X-23" class="fnanchor">X-23</a> No imagination
is necessary in order to understand the courage
which More displayed in making a vigorous attack
in the sixteenth century upon war.</p>

<p>Under limited conditions, however, war is justifiable.
More gives three worthy reasons for declaring
war: (1) the defense of one’s own country;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
(2) the defense of the country of one’s friendly
neighbors; and (3) delivering oppressed peoples
anywhere from the yoke and bondage of tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_X-24" href="#Footnote_X-24" class="fnanchor">X-24</a>
From the twentieth century point of view, these
justifications of war are sound.</p>

<p>These reasons are all “defense” factors,—which
is remarkable in view of the fact that they were
enunciated in an age when “offensive” wars were
common. The only reason for assuming the
offensive in matters of war is the social one of taking
land away from people who deliberately withhold
land from cultivation and fail to produce
food for the nourishment of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_X-25" href="#Footnote_X-25" class="fnanchor">X-25</a> By this
plan, More severely indicts the holders of large
landed estates which are held chiefly for the selfish
gratification of the owners.</p>

<p>Hired or mercenary soldiers are employed in
war. The people of Amaurote employ hideous,
savage fighters from the wild woods and the high
mountains to do their fighting for them. The
larger the number of these impetuous barbarians
who are killed in battle, the better off is the world.</p>

<p>More opposed conscription. Ordinarily, no one
is forced to fight, because under such circumstances
he will not fight well. In the case, however, of defending
Amaurote, the cowards are distributed
among the bold-hearted. In warfare, the people of
Amaurote do not allow their warriors to lay waste
or destroy the land of their enemies. Neither foraging
nor the burning of food supplies is permitted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
No one who is unarmed is to be hurt.</p>

<p>More’s penological ideas are modern. He points
out the folly of making theft a capital offense the
same as murder. The temptation will be to steal,
or rob, and to kill also, whereas under a more reasonable
law the temptation in many cases would be
to steal only. A law which makes theft a capital
offense is harsher than even the harsh Mosaic law
of an eye for an eye, a life for a life, because the
former justifies the government in taking the life
of an individual who is guilty of stealing money.
In Utopia the thief is compelled to restore the stolen
goods to the person from whom he stole, and not to
the king, as in many lands in More’s time. The
thief is put at common labor, not thrown into a city
or county jail and left in idleness. Compulsory
labor is the common method of punishment.<a id="FNanchor_X-26" href="#Footnote_X-26" class="fnanchor">X-26</a></p>

<p>The fundamental penological principle which
More developed was that crime should be prevented
by taking away the occasion of offense.<a id="FNanchor_X-27" href="#Footnote_X-27" class="fnanchor">X-27</a> He condemned
the prevailing method in England of allowing
wickedness to increase, and then of punishing
the sinners after they had been permitted to grow
up in an environment of sin. He objected to taking
men from the trades for war service and then
later irresponsibly discharging them, leaving many
of them industrially stranded, unemployed, and subject
to the temptation of stealing. More’s dictum
was: Show people how to live; do not let them steal
and then take their lives away. Life in Utopia is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
more or less equally divided between five factors:
industry, study, music, travel, and domesticity.</p>

<p>In the <i>Utopia</i>, Sir Thomas More made a direct
criticism of conditions in England; he showed himself
an able student of social problems; and his
ideas are noted for their “modernness.” Altogether,
the <i>Utopia</i> has made a remarkable impression,
not simply upon social idealists but also upon
practical thinkers. As a literary invention for
shrewdly suggesting criticisms of vicious but entrenched
social wrongs it has been followed by imitations,
but remains unparalleled in quality.</p>

<p>In the <i>New Atlantis</i>, Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1628),
wrote an unfinished description of a utopian
island where there is a high degree of social welfare
and where “social salvation by scientific education”
obtains. An Order or Society of “Solomon’s
House” is established which sends out every
twelve years merchants of light (intellectual) who
travel for the following period of twelve years,
gathering facts in all branches of science and art.<a id="FNanchor_X-28" href="#Footnote_X-28" class="fnanchor">X-28</a>
Upon being relieved by the next group of traveler
scholars, they return home and contribute their
knowledge to the acquired store, which in the meantime
has been added unto by many trained experimenters
and research scholars. Airplanes, horseless
wagons, and submarines are not unknown in
the <i>New Atlantis</i>. Superstition is banished. Social
knowledge will lead to a nation of socialized persons,—this
is the Baconian implication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639), a monk, a
philosopher, and an Italian contemporary of Francis
Bacon, urged that human nature should be studied
rather than books. Because of so-called heretical
ideas, he was imprisoned for twenty-seven
years. Shortly after his release he fled to Paris,
where he died. In prison he wrote <i>The City of the
Sun</i>, a crude but significant psychological analysis
of society. It is a social order based on the balanced
relations of the three principles of Power, Intelligence,
and Love. These forces are equally expressed
in the social process and produce a perfect
society.</p>

<p><i>Oceana</i>, “a Midsummer Night’s Dream of politics,”
is the title of a romance which was written by
James Harrington (1611–1677). His social order
rests on economic factors, chiefly landed estates.
However, the author advocates the election of
rulers by ballot every three years and the choosing
of the rulers from the intellectually élite.</p>

<p>In this chapter it is impossible to note all the
“utopias” that have been written. The utopian and
communistic systems of socialists, such as Fourier,
Saint Simon, and Owen will be referred to in <a href="#Chapter_XIV">Chapter
XIV</a>. There are other important utopian contributions,
such as those by William Morris and
Edward Bellamy. In <i>News from Nowhere</i>, William
Morris (1834–1896), an English artist and
socialist, describes his native England as a perfected
society under a régime of socialism. Because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of its American setting, Bellamy’s <i>Looking Backward</i>
will be presented in some detail in the following
paragraphs.</p>

<p>In recent decades the utopian postulates of Edward
Bellamy (1850–1898), in <i>Looking Backward</i>
and <i>Equality</i> have had a wide reading. The author
was the first American to command attention in the
field of utopian thought. Bellamy presents a plan
of industrial organization on a national scale with
individuals sharing equally in the products of labor,
or in public income, in the same way that “men
share equally in the free gifts of nature.” Bellamy
protests against an economic order whose chief evil
is summed up in the following question: How can
men be free who must ask the right to labor and
to live from their fellows, and seek their bread from
the hand of others?</p>

<p>Society is likened to a gigantic coach to which
the masses of humanity are harnessed, toiling along
a very hilly and sandy road. The best seats are on
top of the coach. The occupants of the elegant seats
are constantly in fear of falling from their cushions
of ease, splendor, and power,—and hence their interest
in the toilers.</p>

<p>In <i>Looking Backward</i> the entire social process
is made an expression of service. Service is a matter
of course, not of compulsion. No business is so
fundamentally the public’s business as the industry
and trade on which the livelihood of the public depends.<a id="FNanchor_X-29" href="#Footnote_X-29" class="fnanchor">X-29</a>
Therefore, to intrust industry and commerce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
to private persons to be managed for private
profit is a folly “similar to that of surrendering the
functions of political government to kings and
nobles for their personal glorification.”</p>

<p>Buying and selling are pronounced anti-social.
They are an education in self-seeking at the expense
of others.<a id="FNanchor_X-30" href="#Footnote_X-30" class="fnanchor">X-30</a> Citizens who are so trained are unable
to rise above a very low grade of civilization.<a id="FNanchor_X-31" href="#Footnote_X-31" class="fnanchor">X-31</a>
They are sensible chiefly to such motives as fear
of want and love of luxury. For buying and selling,
credit books are substituted which are good at
any public warehouse. In place of higher wages,
the chief motives to activity are honor, men’s gratitude,
the inspiration of duty, patriotism, the satisfaction
of doing one’s work well—in other words,
the same motives that now influence, for example,
the members of the teaching profession.</p>

<p>The arduousness of the trades are equalized, so
that all shall be equally attractive, by making the
hours of labor in different trades to differ inversely
according to arduousness.<a id="FNanchor_X-32" href="#Footnote_X-32" class="fnanchor">X-32</a> Everyone works as a
common laborer for three years and then chooses
an occupation—agriculture, mechanics, the professions,
art. The working life is twenty-four years
long, from the ages of twenty-one to forty-five,
after which all may devote themselves to self-improvement
and enjoyment, but subject to emergency
calls along industrial and other social service lines.</p>

<p>Bellamy challenges an individualism which incapacitates
people for co-operation. He builds his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
society upon solidarity of race and brotherhood of
man. He does not fear corruption in a society
“where there is neither poverty to be bribed nor
wealth to bribe.”<a id="FNanchor_X-33" href="#Footnote_X-33" class="fnanchor">X-33</a></p>

<p>All cases of criminal atavism are treated in hospitals.
There are no jails. Under capitalism nineteen-twentieths
of misdemeanors are due to economic
inequality. The remainder are the outcropping
of ancestral traits. In Bellamy’s ideal society
there are no private property disputes and no lawyers.</p>

<p>The educational system in <i>Looking Backward</i>
does not educate some individuals highly and leave
others untrained.<a id="FNanchor_X-34" href="#Footnote_X-34" class="fnanchor">X-34</a> It gives everyone “the completest
education that the nation can give,” in order
that individuals may enjoy themselves, in order that
they may enjoy one another, and in order that the
unborn may be guaranteed an intelligent and refined
parentage.</p>

<p>Bellamy holds that human nature in its essential
quality is good, not bad, and that men are naturally
generous, not selfish; pitiful, not cruel; godlike in
aspirations, moved by divine impulses of goodness,
images of God and not the travesties upon Him
which they have seemed.<a id="FNanchor_X-35" href="#Footnote_X-35" class="fnanchor">X-35</a> It is our economic order
which has fostered shameless self-assertion, mutual
depreciation, a stunning clamor of conflicting
boasts, and a stupendous system of brazen beggary.</p>

<p>In three utopias, H. G. Wells portrays societary
conditions that are kinetic rather than static and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
world-wide rather than local in scope.<a id="FNanchor_X-36" href="#Footnote_X-36" class="fnanchor">X-36</a> While the
author provides a changed economic system, socialistic
in nature, he urges that changed social attitudes
are also needed.</p>

<p>In the utopian social thought that has been presented
in this chapter and in similar works which
are not mentioned here there is generally displayed
(1) a common weakness of impracticability under
current circumstances, (2) an over-emphasis upon
simply changing the economic order, and (3) static
rather than dynamic principles. The strength of
utopian social thought is found (1) in its drastic
criticism of current social evils, (2) in its relative
harmlessness at the given time, (3) in the force of
its indirect suggestion, (4) in the widespread hearing
which it secures, and (5) in its social idealism.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Individualistic Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>At the dawn of the Renaissance, tradition and
dogmatism were ruling mankind. Here and there,
however, individuals were perceiving the nature of
the bondage. Occasionally a cry for individual freedom
was uttered. Petrarch dared to say that the
world was made for man’s enjoyment. The early
Teutons crudely developed the idea of personal liberty.
In France a movement arose which culminated
in the doctrines of natural rights and “Back
to Nature.” The stress upon individualism in
England became so deeply ingrained that it exists
today as a powerful form of traditionalism. The
United States was founded, in part, upon a doctrine
of natural rights.</p>

<p>Absolutely unlike Sir Thomas More in many
ways, Niccolo Machiavelli (1469–1527), an Italian
contemporary, broke with tradition and received
the sobriquet, the Galileo of social science. Unfortunately,
many people think of the Italian writer
in terms of the adjective which bears his name,
Machiavellism, or political intrigue. While he deserves
this reputation, he also should be considered
in another light. He cut loose from the customary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
ways of thinking of his time and asserted that it is
not necessary to take all things on fiat or alleged
divine decree. Although this may be dangerous
doctrine, it serves a useful and constructive purpose
when people are ruled by political and ecclesiastical
autocrats. Machiavelli was no idealist in the accepted
sense of the term, but a man who mixed with
people, traveled extensively, and studied actual conditions.
He declared that people should be considered
as they are, and not according to false
teachings about them.</p>

<p>A century before the time of Sir Francis Bacon,
the inaugurator of the so-called inductive or scientific
method of study, Machiavelli was observing
human conditions and upon the basis of these observations
was drawing conclusions. He believed
that it does not pay to be guided in one’s conduct
by abstract ethics or impracticable ideals—and said
so, in an age when imprisonment, exile, or death
awaited anyone who opposed the autocratic authorities.
From abstract ethics, Machiavelli swung to
the extreme of concrete expediency. He lived and
thought in the exigencies of the moment. He is
an example of one who reacts so strongly against
the stress and strain of the hour that he cannot get
the larger vision that is necessary for balanced
thinking on fundamental issues.</p>

<p>Machiavelli wrote on the subject of leadership
and government. He advocated either an autocratic
or democratic form of government—according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
to the conditions of the time and place. In the
<i>Prince</i> he described with noteworthy accuracy the
traits and methods of a leader whose constituents
must be treated with absolute authority. In the
<i>Discourses</i> he dealt with a democratic-republican
type of leadership and control.</p>

<p>The succesful prince, or leader, in the selfish
sense, makes himself both beloved and feared by
his people.<a id="FNanchor_XI-1" href="#Footnote_XI-1" class="fnanchor">XI-1</a> On occasion he uses force and even
fraud. Sometimes he must either exterminate or
be exterminated. He must repeal or suppress old
laws and make new ones to fit the social situation.
He seeks to be considered merciful rather than
cruel. He exercises universal pity in order to prevent
social disorders from occurring and producing
rapine and murder.<a id="FNanchor_XI-2" href="#Footnote_XI-2" class="fnanchor">XI-2</a> He does not allow his
mercy to be taken advantage of by ungrateful and
hypocritical persons. He is strong-minded; he is
either a sincere friend or a generous foe. He is
paternalistic, urging that his subjects be well-fed
and have a good livelihood,<a id="FNanchor_XI-3" href="#Footnote_XI-3" class="fnanchor">XI-3</a> thus gaining and maintaining
the affection of the people. In international
affairs he acts with a strong hand, fortifying well
his city or nation, and providing good laws for internal
growth.<a id="FNanchor_XI-4" href="#Footnote_XI-4" class="fnanchor">XI-4</a> He errs grossly, however, in his
fundamental philosophy that any plan or action that
is for the welfare of the state, or nation, considered
as a supreme unit of authority in itself, is morally
sound.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Bacon, whose contribution to utopian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
social thought has been indicated in the foregoing
chapter, placed all social and sociological thinkers
under deep obligations by his emphasis upon inductive
reasoning. He helped to free the individual
from control by dogma and superstition. He provided
the individual with a technique for securing
a new sense of individual freedom. In freeing himself
the individual discards his irrational pre-judgments,
whether socially inherited or individually
developed. He protects himself from anthropomorphic
judgments, i. e., from judgments which
he makes because he looks upon life and the universe
through human eyes. These pre-judgments
are common to all mankind—they are “the idols of
the tribe.” On the other hand, the individual avoids
purely personal preferences, which he is likely to
hold because of his own peculiar experiences, and
which thus place him outside the pale of common
experience—these are “the idols of the cave.”</p>

<p>Then there are “the idols of the forum,” which
cause the individual to give undue dependence to
words and language. “The idols of the theater”
are traditional systems of thought. Bacon’s dictum
has been stated as follows: Get as little of yourself
and of other selves as possible in the way of
the thing which you wish to see.</p>

<p>Having eliminated human predispositions, the individual
is ready to gather facts, arrange them in
groups, draw conclusions from them, and act according
to the resultant laws. Knowledge gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
power.<a id="FNanchor_XI-4a" href="#missing" class="fnanchor">XI-4</a> Social knowledge gives power to improve
human conditions and makes possible wise social
control. Thus, Bacon opened the road to individual
freedom.</p>

<p>Too much individual freedom, however, destroys
government and the social order. If each individual
is a law unto himself, anarchy reigns and progress
is prevented. Consequently, the question arises:
How can individually free persons unite in a society
without giving up their freedom? The answer to
this question took the form of a controversy on the
subject of the social contract, i. e., the contract or
agreement of individuals, as units, to form and
maintain societies. This controversy arose in the
seventeenth century and was waged vigorously in
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Thomas Hobbes (1588–1678), the distinguished
social philosopher of England, introduced his analysis
of society with the idea that man was originally
self-centered, egoistic, and pleasure-loving. He was
an independent center. His interest in other people
was based on their ability to cater to his own good.
He and they desired the same things in life. His
hand was thus raised, in competition, against every
other man. This state of continual conflict became
mutually destructive and unbearable.<a id="FNanchor_XI-5" href="#Footnote_XI-5" class="fnanchor">XI-5</a> In consequence,
each individual agreed to give over some
of his precious, inalienable rights to a central authority
or sovereign, whose decrees should constitute
law and serve as the guide for conduct. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
war of each against all, with the concomitant state
of fear, was thus supplanted by a mutual contract,
conferring sovereignty by popular agreement upon
the ruler. In this way Hobbes met the dilemma of
supporting an absolute form of government in
which he believed and of denying the divine right
of kings which he abhorred. Hobbes performed a
useful service in intellectually destroying the idea
of the divine right of kings, but urged after all an
undemocratic political absolutism. Hobbes conferred
humanly derived but irrevocable authority
upon the king. He, however, traced sovereignty
back to the people rather than to a divine right.</p>

<p>In getting away from the conditions “of Warre
of every one against every one” in the natural state
where “every man has a Right to everything,”
Hobbes swung to an undemocratic extreme. His
Puritanic training gave an undue severity to his
social thought. The Puritans, however, believed in
the complete eradication of the savage human tendencies
and also in the ultimate elimination of
kings. Hobbes did not analyze deeply the instinctive
bases of human nature. He built his <i>Leviathan</i>
out of natural human qualities and tied its units
together by means of a strong, central will—this
was his perfect society.</p>

<p>Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), the Portuguese
Jewish philosopher of Holland, improved the social
contract idea. He believed that man was originally
of an anti-social and a tooth-and-fang nature, possessing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
only incipient social impulses. Hence, man
is not naturally bad, but naturally anti-social. Social
organization was effected for purposes of individual
gain and glory; it was promulgated and
furthered by individuals in order that they might
escape the miseries of unregulated conflict. Agreements
were made whereby sovereignty was embodied
in a ruler, but if the ruler abused the sovereignty
entrusted to him, it reverted immediately to
the people. This democratic conception was vastly
superior to the idea of Hobbes, that sovereignty is
delegated by the people to the king as an irresponsible
monarch.</p>

<p>John Locke (1632–1704) strengthened the social
contract theory, elaborating the idea that sovereignty
reverts to the people whenever the king becomes
a tyrant. He held that the natural state of
individuals is a condition of perfect freedom to
order their actions, not asking leave of any man.<a id="FNanchor_XI-6" href="#Footnote_XI-6" class="fnanchor">XI-6</a>
This state of liberty is not a state of license to individuals
to destroy themselves or their neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_XI-7" href="#Footnote_XI-7" class="fnanchor">XI-7</a>
The state of liberty has the law of nature to govern
it. Since all are equal, no one ought to harm another
in his liberty or possessions.</p>

<p>Locke affirmed that men are in a state of nature
until by their own consent they join in a political
society.<a id="FNanchor_XI-8" href="#Footnote_XI-8" class="fnanchor">XI-8</a> In order to meet their needs effectively,
they join in societies. One of these important needs
is the preservation of property. Locke defended
private property on the ground that it is a normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
expression of individuality and necessary to individuality.</p>

<p>Right and wrong are not determined by the ruler
or the state; they existed before society developed.
Here the Puritanism of Locke enters. He stressed
moral values. He made the natural rights of individuals
supreme; individuals may even overturn the
government and still keep within their rights.</p>

<p>Locke’s justification of revolution is his most
startling doctrine. Imagine the heart-throb of the
common people who heard Locke’s contention that
the end of government is the good of mankind,
that people should not submit to tyranny, that whoever
uses his force without right and law puts himself
in a state of war with those against whom he
uses it, and that in such a state the people have a
right to resist and defend themselves.<a id="FNanchor_XI-9" href="#Footnote_XI-9" class="fnanchor">XI-9</a> Further,
the people have a right to act as the supreme social
force and to put legislation into new forms and
into the hands of new executives. By these bold
declarations Locke created a new public opinion,
and aroused new moral power in the minds and
hearts of the common people.</p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century the concept
of individual freedom became crystallized in
the doctrines of the natural rights of the individual,
the contractual societary relationships between independent
individuals, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> principle
in governmental science. The physiocrats,
who took up the ideas of natural liberty and economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
freedom, exercised a tremendous influence in
France during the three decades following 1750.
Their leaders were Quesnay, de Gournay, Condorcet,
and Turgot. They believed that there was
a natural law ruling human lives, just as there is a
natural law ruling the physical world. They chafed
under social restraints. Under the natural law,
every individual has natural rights, chief of which
is the right to the free exercise of all his faculties
so long as he does not infringe on the similar right
of other individuals. Unlike John Locke and other
English thinkers who accepted the idea of individual
liberty, the physiocrats argued that this
natural liberty could not be abridged by a social
contract.</p>

<p>According to the physiocrats the chief function
of governmental control is to preserve the natural
liberty of individuals. Industry and commerce
must not be governmentally regulated, for by such
regulation the rights of some men, chiefly employers,
will be infringed upon. Employees, on the
other hand, who are being treated unjustly will
freely quit a harsh employer and obtain employment
with considerate masters. Thus, an unjust
employer will be unable to secure workers and be
forced to discontinue his unjust practices—without
government regulation. Likewise, a dishonest merchant
will lose his customers and be forced to
become honest or to close his shop—and again without
government regulation. The physiocrats became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
known by their famous phrase, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire,
laissez passer</i>.</p>

<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), an able but
baffling character, is the best known champion of
the social contract idea. Although he advocated
the family as a social institution and praised fatherhood,
he reports that he carried his own children
to a foundling asylum. He deprecated the disintegrating
elements in civilization and urged a return
to nature’s simple ways. In his chief works,
the <i>Contrat social</i> and <i>Emile</i>, he attacked civilization
vigorously. He asserted that civilization had
almost destroyed the natural rights of man. His
dictum was: Trust nature.</p>

<p>According to Rousseau the early life of mankind
was nearly ideal in its simplicity and pleasantness.
War and conflict were relatively unknown. In his
later writings, Rousseau modified his belief and
asserted that primitive confusion made necessary
some kind of social organization. On the other
hand, it became the belief of Rousseau that civilization
generates social evils and results sooner or
later in social deterioration. Corruption in society
has become notorious. Social inequality is rampant
and unbearable. “Man is born free, and is everywhere
in chains.” People have become so engrossed
in the artificialities of social life and so bewildered
by its complexities that happiness has been lost.</p>

<p>Leave the individual free to carry out his own
plans, untrammelled by complex social rules, restrictions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
and duties. There is no social sanction
at all; there is no authority except nature, which
is necessity. In <i>Emile</i>, Rousseau takes his two
leading characters to an island, where they live
alone—happily! Liberty not authority reigns. But
Emile, who has declared for liberty as opposed to
authority, insists in his discussions of domestic relationships
that “woman is made to please man.”
The “unselfish, unsocial life” of Emile and Sophie
turns out to be more than purely individualistic—it
is anarchic and sensual. Emile fails to demonstrate
the merit of Rousseau’s own theories, such
as “Man is good naturally but by institutions he is
made bad,” and “Everything is good as it comes
from the hands of the Author of Nature; everything
degenerates in the hands of man.”</p>

<p>Slavery is wrong, according to Rousseau.<a id="FNanchor_XI-11" href="#Footnote_XI-11" class="fnanchor">XI-11</a> It is
a contract or agreement, at the expense of the slave
and for the profit of the slaveholder, in which the
slaveholder asserts: I’ll observe the agreement and
you will observe it—as long as it pleases me.</p>

<p>Strength does not make right. Strength and
moral force are not necessarily the same. Strength
may often be ironically accepted in appearance and
established in principle. By a social contract man
loses his natural liberty and gains civil and moral
liberty.<a id="FNanchor_XI-12" href="#Footnote_XI-12" class="fnanchor">XI-12</a> In this connection Rousseau was simply
the spokesman of a point of view which found frequent
expression in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. For example, in 1635, John Winthrop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
the first governor of the Massachusetts colony,
made a clear-cut distinction between natural liberties,
and civil and moral liberties. Natural liberty
is liberty to do what one lists, to do evil as well as
good. Civil, or moral, liberty is liberty under the
covenant between God and man, under the political
covenants between men and men, and under the
moral law. It is a liberty to do only that which is
good, just, and honest.<a id="FNanchor_XI-13" href="#Footnote_XI-13" class="fnanchor">XI-13</a></p>

<p>It was Rousseau who contended that life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness are man’s inalienable
rights. It was this doctrine which profoundly influenced
Thomas Jefferson, as evidenced in the
Declaration of Independence. Sovereignty rests not
in a ruler or monarch but in the community of
people—this was perhaps Rousseau’s main contribution
to social thought.</p>

<p>Before Rousseau, however, wrote the <i>Contrat
social</i>, the social contract theory had been overthrown.
The writings of Montesquieu (1689–1755)
offer an elaborate analysis of social and political
processes. These analyses are similar, in some
ways, to Aristotle’s analyses of 158 constitutions.
Montesquieu discussed the doctrine of natural
rights, but did not believe that the natural state of
mankind was one of conflict, in which social organization
was forced as a means of meeting the
needs of individual protection. He asserted that
there was a natural, innate tendency in man toward
association. In the support of this belief, Montesquieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
drew facts from the lives of the individual
members of the primitive tribes which were extant
in his day. The influence of Montesquieu was
clearly inimical to the social contract doctrine.</p>

<p>In the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Esprit des lois</i>, Montesquieu dissected the
laws of many nations and tried to show the relations
between these laws and social and political
conditions. The general implication is that laws
are a natural outgrowth of life conditions rather
than of formal contractual agreements. Hence,
society is a natural evolution rather than a contract.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief antagonist in the eighteenth
century of the social contract theory was David
Hume (1711–1776), the father of social psychology.
According to Hume, the origin of society was not
in a contract arrived at by intellectual processes;
it was instinctive. Man is a social animal. At the
basis of this sociability lies the sex instinct, which
resulted in the establishment of the family. The
sex instinct is strongly supported by the sentiment
of sympathy, which also is innate, and which may
develop into intelligent co-operation. Man is not
entirely self-centered; he takes pleasure in other
people’s pleasures and suffers when others are in
pain, or the victims of disease, or are dying.</p>

<p>Sympathy, like the sex instinct, is a genuinely
fundamental element in human nature and in
society. However, the combination of sympathy
and the sex instinct is not strong enough to support
the family in either its simple or complex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
stages from the attacks upon it that are made by
inherent human selfishness. Hence, social and political
organizations are necessary to hold the selfish
impulses and interests of mankind in check. Intellectual
control of society thus becomes necessary
and consciously recognized. Environment alone
does not cause people in a given community to act
alike. It is imitation, primarily, which operates to
bring about group conformity.<a id="FNanchor_XI-14" href="#Footnote_XI-14" class="fnanchor">XI-14</a></p>

<p>Man in a large measure is governed by interest.
It is impossible for men to consult their interests
“in so effective a manner as by a universal and inflexible
observance of the rules of justice, by which
alone they can preserve society, and keep themselves
from falling into that wretched and savage
condition, which is commonly represented as the
state of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_XI-15" href="#Footnote_XI-15" class="fnanchor">XI-15</a></p>

<p>According to the contract theory, people expect
protection and security. If they meet with tyranny
and oppression, they are freed from their promises
and return to that state of liberty which proceeded
the institution of government. But Hume maintained
that if people entered into no contract and
made no promises, government would still be necessary
in all civilized societies. The obligation of submission
to government is not derived from any
promise of the subjects.<a id="FNanchor_XI-16" href="#Footnote_XI-16" class="fnanchor">XI-16</a></p>

<p>Adam Ferguson (1723–1816) wrote an <i>Essay on
the History of Civil Society</i> and <i>The History of the
Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
He argued that social institutions and social convenience
lead to inherent sociability, and pointed out
that competition and conflict are vital to social
development. Thomas Paine (1737–1809) asserted
that man is inherently social and that social organization
is a natural development.</p>

<p>The natural rights theory and the resultant individualism
not only repudiated their false derivative,
the social contract concept, but also wrestled
with considerable success with the socio-economic
concept of mercantilism. Mercantilism was a system
of regulating industrial enterprise by governments
in order to build up strong nation-states.
Mercantilism reached its strictest form in France
in the writings of Colbert (1619–1683). It prevailed
in Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and the first four decades of the
eighteenth century. It was a system which grew
out of feudalism and the city-state type of society.
It operated to bring together towns and cities into
national unities. Under feudalism, the town had
regulated industry for its own advancement and
against the welfare, perchance, of neighboring
towns. Mercantilism served to unite towns and to
create in townspeople a national loyalty.</p>

<p>Under mercantilism, the nation entered upon the
task of regulating industry and finance so as to
build a strong state. A favorable balance of trade
was sought in order to add to the bullion within
the state. High tariffs were enacted, which sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
defeated the intended purposes. A dense population
was favored as a means of securing cheap
labor, and hence of furthering manufacture, which
in turn would develop foreign trade and bring in
the coveted bullion—the heralded strength of a
nation.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, mercantilism in France
and England met defeat in the contest with the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> theory, with which the names of the
physiocrats and of Adam Smith are inseparably
connected. It often fathered too stringent regulations.
Instead of supporting national ends, mercantilistic
measures frequently furthered private
interests. Mercantilism, however, played a strong
part in building up the concepts of national unity
and loyalty.</p>

<p>In the German states and Austria, cameralism
represented the ideas for which mercantilism stood
in England, France, and elsewhere in Western and
Southern Europe. Among the leading cameralists
were Seckendorf, Horing, Justi, and Sonnenfels.
Cameralism obtained a far deeper hold upon the
German states than mercantilism did, for example,
in England. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> philosophy was never
able to make a deep inroad upon cameralism. In
fact, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> philosophy did not receive
serious consideration in the German states before
1800, and did not strike deep. National self-sufficiency,
paternalistic control, minute regulation
of internal affairs, rearing of large families, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
subordination of the welfare of the state—these
are the concepts which ruled in Germany.</p>

<p>Adam Smith (1723–1790), primarily an economist
and often referred to as the father of political
economy, exerted a profound influence upon social
thought. He coupled a modified natural rights
theory with a doctrine of sympathy; he spoke for
the natural rights of the individual, of the poorer
classes in society, and of the smaller nations. He
vigorously attacked mercantilism with its system of
minute regulation of individuals. He objected to
promoting unduly the interests of one class of men
in a country, for by so doing, the interests of all
other classes in that country and of all persons in
all other countries are harmed.<a id="FNanchor_XI-17" href="#Footnote_XI-17" class="fnanchor">XI-17</a> He pointed out
the fallacy of building a nation of shopkeepers, for
in so doing the government of such a nation will
be unduly influenced and controlled by the interests
of shopkeepers. The interests of other classes will
be more or less ignored. Adam Smith protested
against Great Britain’s methods of regulating the
American colonies. To prohibit the American
colonies from making all they could of every part
of their own produce or from employing their stock
and industry in the way that they judged most advantageous
to themselves, was “a manifest violation
of the most sacred rights of mankind.”<a id="FNanchor_XI-18" href="#Footnote_XI-18" class="fnanchor">XI-18</a></p>

<p>Mercantilism made use of monopoly of one kind
or another, and hence is objectionable, according to
Smith. Mercantilism is regulation, and regulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
is often carried on for the benefit of the rich and
powerful, thus neglecting and oppressing the poor.<a id="FNanchor_XI-19" href="#Footnote_XI-19" class="fnanchor">XI-19</a>
Smith failed to note, however, that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i>
policy likewise favored the rich and powerful and
neglected the poor. Mercantilism, according to
Smith, considers production and not consumption
as the end of industry and commerce, and thus
favors one class at the expense of other classes.</p>

<p>“Wherever there is great property,” said Smith,
“there is great inequality.” For every very rich
man there must be at least 500 poor men, and the
affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the
many.<a id="FNanchor_XI-20" href="#Footnote_XI-20" class="fnanchor">XI-20</a> But no society can be flourishing and
happy wherein the greater part of the members are
poor and miserable.<a id="FNanchor_XI-21" href="#Footnote_XI-21" class="fnanchor">XI-21</a> The laboring men should
have “such a share of the produce of their own
labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed,
and lodged.” Poverty does not prevent the procreation
of children, but is on the other hand extremely
unfavorable to the rearing of children.<a id="FNanchor_XI-22" href="#Footnote_XI-22" class="fnanchor">XI-22</a></p>

<p>Smith pointed out four causes of social inequality:<a id="FNanchor_XI-23" href="#Footnote_XI-23" class="fnanchor">XI-23</a>
(1) Superiority in personal qualifications,
such as strength, beauty, agility of body; or wisdom,
virtue, prudence, justice, fortitude, moderation
of mind. (2) Superiority of age and experience.
(3) Superiority of fortune. Riches give
social authority; riches possess power to buy.
(4) Superiority of birth, based on family prestige.</p>

<p>Smith extolled the merits of division of labor
in industry with the resultant increase in the quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
of work. There are three sets of causal circumstances:<a id="FNanchor_XI-24" href="#Footnote_XI-24" class="fnanchor">XI-24</a>
(1) the increase of dexterity; (2) the
saving of time in passing from one kind of work
to another; and (3) the invention of a large number
of machines. Smith, however, deplored the
deadening effect upon the individual of repeating
over and over a simple process, hundreds or thousands
of times daily. In summary, Adam Smith
(1) applied the concept of natural rights to industrial
conditions; (2) developed Hume’s concept of
sympathy into a theory of mutual aid between individuals,
classes, and nations; and (3) supported
the necessity of division of labor.</p>

<p>The natural rights and social contract theories
affected in one way or another the thinking not
only of the men who have already been considered
in this chapter, but also of many other individuals.
Blackstone (1723–1780) held that man’s weakness
in isolation led to association. The primary group
was the patriarchal family. Blackstone was not an
advocate of social regulation. His exposition of
English law in the <i>Commentaries</i> stood for law
itself, and became the bulwark at once of the doctrines
of individual rights and property rights in
both England and the American colonies. In the
United States, its influence remained dominant for
more than a century after the founding of the
republic.</p>

<p>Although Edmund Burke (1729–1797) believed
in a corporate unity of society, he became in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
century the chief spokesman of humanity for humanity’s
sake. He pleaded for justice for and conciliation
with the American colonies; he spoke for
the benighted Hindus who were being plundered by
English stockholders; and he championed the rights
of slaves. He failed, on the other hand, to appreciate
the struggles of the French people which culminated
in the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Immanuel Kant (1724–1817) declared man in a
natural state is both social and unsocial and referred
to the “unsocial sociableness” of man. “Man
cannot get on with fellows and he cannot do without
them.” Man has an inclination to associate
with others and also a great propensity to isolate
himself from others. He wishes to direct things
according to his own ideas and thus courts resistance
and conflict. It is this conflict, however, which
leads to individual advancement.</p>

<p>Kant laid great stress upon a good will.<a id="FNanchor_XI-25" href="#Footnote_XI-25" class="fnanchor">XI-25</a> The
individual may have intelligence and sagacity,
power and wealth, but he may still be a pernicious
and hurtful member of society. He is not even
worthy to be happy unless he possesses a good will.
A man’s will is good not because of the end he
seeks nor because of the results of his activities
but because he inherently wills the good. It is this
“good will” of Kant which is in conflict with the
utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, and also with
modern behavioristic psychology and objective sociology.
To Kant, morality is subjective. Social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
laws may regulate and control man’s conduct but
they cannot control his motives.</p>

<p>Johann Fichte (1762–1814) joined with Kant in
the interpretation of a good will. He held that
property is essential to the development of freedom.
However, he pushed the social contract idea to an
extreme and developed a doctrine of an idealistic
state socialism, including the superiority of Germany
among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>Hegel (1770–1831) supported cameralism by developing
the State idea, with the implication that
Germany would become the supreme State in the
world. Hegel even asserted that man has his existence
and his ethical status “only in being a member
of the State.”<a id="FNanchor_XI-26" href="#Footnote_XI-26" class="fnanchor">XI-26</a> Morality is not a matter of striving
independently to realize one’s inner self, but of
living in accord with the traditions of one’s State.</p>

<p>Perhaps the individual rights theory never manifested
a greater aberration than in the mind of
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900). Power is supreme.
The individual or the nation with the
greatest power has the greatest right to live.
Against this idea or the expressions of this idea,
the weaker individuals tend to combine and to extol
their weaknesses as virtues, even building a religion
out of these glorified weaknesses, for example,
Christianity. Nietzsche’s doctrine of the superman
and the superstate will be discussed in <a href="#Chapter_XXI">Chapter
XXI</a>.</p>

<p>Closely related to the discussions concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
natural rights and the social contract is the doctrine
of utilitarianism, a modified form of individualism
with certain objective standards. Jeremy
Bentham (1748–1832) made utilitarianism well-known,
and particularly the standard: The greatest
good of the greatest number. In accordance
with a formal idea of social change, Bentham urged
that social improvements be made by legislation.
He demanded objective standards as opposed to
Kant’s emphasis on the inner motive. Where Kant
accented the “how” of conduct, Bentham insisted
on the “what” of conduct. He pointed out the
need for improved forms of government, apparently
ignoring or at least greatly underestimating
the fact that real progress comes chiefly through
modifying organic processes. However, Bentham
may be rated a virile social reformer, for he
strongly advocated such measures as the secret ballot,
woman suffrage, trained statesmancraft. He
made social welfare a main goal.</p>

<p>The doctrine of utilitarianism was carried forward
by James Mill (1773–1836) and was brought
to its highest fruition by the son, John Stuart Mill
(1806–1873). The elder Mill contended that utility
is morality. Like Bentham the elder Mill urged
many social reforms.</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill adopted a modified form of the
natural rights theory. He asserted that the individual
should have all the rights that he can exercise
without infringing upon the equal rights of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
other individuals. Mill recognized a gradation in
the pleasures which satisfy individuals. He declared
that it is better to be a man dissatisfied than
a pig satisfied; he objected to the prevailing classification
of people on the basis of poverty and wealth,
and urged the substitution of standards of personal
worth, honor, and true leadership as bases for social
classification.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Maine (1832–1888) invented the
phrase: From status to contract. He applied this
phrase to a program of social welfare. There are
many illustrations, he pointed out, in business and
industrial life, and even in political and fraternal
activities where people make social contracts. The
marriage contract also has many of the characteristics
of a genuine social contract. Maine pushed the
social contract idea to its furthest practical point;
but deprecated the possibility that the masses might
come into power. His individualism deprived him
of a faith in the possible social development of the
uneducated.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, whose ideas will be discussed
more extensively in a subsequent chapter, became
one of the chief exponents of the doctrine of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez
faire</i> in governmental matters. He brought a vast
reading knowledge and able arguments to the support
of individualistic doctrines. He added very
little that was new to individualistic and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez
faire</i> theories although he was at one time perhaps
their leading exponent. One of his chief contributions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
to social thought was indirect and unintentional,
namely, the way in which his writings challenged
the attention of an American paleontologist,
Lester F. Ward, and led him to point out the
psychical nature and hence telic possibilities of
civilization. In consequence of this challenge Spencer
fell, and Ward rose to the rank of dean of
American sociologists. An entire chapter will be
devoted to the sociology of Lester F. Ward.</p>

<p>William G. Sumner (1840–1910) was the last
noted champion of a governmental <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i>
doctrine. He held that the State owes nothing to
anybody except peace, order, and the guarantee of
rights. It is not true that the poor ought to care
for each other, and that the churches ought to collect
capital and spend it for the poor; it is not true
that if you get wealth you should support others;
and that if you do not get wealth others ought to
support you. In a society based on contract there
is no place for sentiment in public or common
affairs.<a id="FNanchor_XI-28" href="#Footnote_XI-28" class="fnanchor">XI-28</a> Every individual will develop the self-reliance
of a free person, if he is not taught that
others will care for him in case he fails to care
for himself. Sumner spoke vigorously as well as
harshly in support of liberty, contract, and private
property. Although he took an extreme and untenable
position his ideas will bear careful, unbiased
study, for they contain a large amount of common
sense. His ethnological work will be indicated at
some length in another chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>A noteworthy statement which has come from a
current American school of legal thinkers concerning
individualistic social thought, is found in the
writings of Professor Roscoe Pound of Harvard
Law School. In “A Theory of Social Interests” he
has summed up the new point of view.<a id="FNanchor_XI-29" href="#Footnote_XI-29" class="fnanchor">XI-29</a> In the last
century all interests were thought of in terms of
individual interests, all were reduced to their purely
individual elements and considered as rights.</p>

<p>In this century, Dean Pound indicates that law,
for example, aims primarily to conserve some general
social interest. It conserves the social interest
in the general security, that is, in public health and
in peace. It conserves the social interest in institutions,—domestic,
religious, political. It conserves
the social interest in natural resources, preventing
the waste of oil and gas and protecting water
rights. It conserves the social interest in general
progress, in economic, political, cultural progress,
although its main contribution in other fields, such
as promoting the esthetic interests, are yet to be
made. It conserves the social interests in individual
life and in seeing that people live humanly and that
the will of the individual is not trodden upon.
Legal processes have thus become types of social
engineering.</p>

<p>The doctrine of natural rights reached its largest
degree of acceptance in England, France, and the
United States. It was not only reflected in the
thought of Thomas Jefferson but in the fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
principles upon which the United States
was established. It suffered an aberration in the
form of the social contract theory which in its extreme
forms was later repudiated. Its greatest
weakness was the exaggerated form which it assumed,
especially in England and the United States.
In the latter country it became greatly magnified
through contact with the spirit of discovery, invention,
and pioneering which prevailed for over a
century. Consequently, it dominated the thought
life of the United States throughout the nineteenth
century. It permitted captains of industry to exploit
the helpless masses, and encouraged politicians
to pursue selfish practices until governments became
honeycombed with graft. It nearly capsized
the good Ship of State—Democracy.</p>

<p>Theories of natural rights have been supplanted
by considerations of natural needs, both individual
and social. Human needs are now considered the
only imperatives, but even they are relative and
changing.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Malthus and Population Concepts</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>A unique and distinctive trend in social thought
with important sociological implications developed
in the closing years of the eighteenth century,
namely, Malthusian thought regarding population.
Malthusianism, however, was preceded by the ideas
of William Godwin and Adam Smith. In 1775,
Adam Smith had stated that “every species of
animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the
means of their subsistence, and no species can ever
multiply beyond it.”<a id="FNanchor_XII-1" href="#Footnote_XII-1" class="fnanchor">XII-1</a> Scanty subsistence, however,
destroys a large percentage of offspring. Inasmuch
as men, like all other animals, multiply naturally
in proportion to the means of their subsistence, food
is always, more or less, in demand; and food, or
the cost of living, regulates population.<a id="FNanchor_XII-2" href="#Footnote_XII-2" class="fnanchor">XII-2</a> City people
must depend upon the country for their subsistence,
whereas seaport towns can command food
resources from all parts of the earth.</p>

<p>The population ideas of William Godwin (1756–1836)
were the immediate stimuli which set Malthus
at work. In 1793, Godwin’s <i>Enquiry Concerning
Justice</i> was published. Godwin elaborated several
radical social ideas of the French Physiocratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
philosophers. He declared that human misery is
caused by coercive institutions. Government, he
asserted, is an evil and should be abolished. He
urged also the abolition of strict marriage relations,
although he personally acquiesced in the custom and
in his last days he commended marriage. He
thought that no social group should be larger than
a parish, and that there should be an equal distribution
of property. Godwin thus carried the doctrine
of natural rights to the verge of anarchy and
licentiousness. His ideas furnished a basis for the
nineteenth century experiments in communism.
But what is more important, Godwin’s ideas regarding
the reconstruction of society stimulated Thomas
Malthus, who developed what is commonly known
as the Malthusian doctrine of population.</p>

<p>In 1798, under an assumed name, Thomas Robert
Malthus (1766–1834) offered to the world the
first carefully collected and elaborated body of
data, dealing with what he called <em>the</em> social problem,
namely: What is the underlying cause of
human unhappiness? This study may be counted,
in a sense, the beginning of modern sociological
study. Early in life Malthus showed an interest
in social questions. Godwin’s ideas had centered
Malthus’ attention on population. Malthus’ well-known
treatise entitled, <i>An Essay on the Principle
of Population as it Affects the Future Improvement
of Society</i>, undertook two important tasks:
(1) To investigate the causes that have impeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
the progress of mankind toward happiness, and
(2) to examine probabilities of a total or partial
removal of these causes.<a id="FNanchor_XII-3" href="#Footnote_XII-3" class="fnanchor">XII-3</a></p>

<p>Among both plants and animals there is a constant
tendency to reproduce numerically beyond the
subsistence level. Wherever there is liberty, this
power of increase blindly asserts itself. Afterwards,
a lack of nourishment and of room represses
the superabundant numbers.<a id="FNanchor_XII-4" href="#Footnote_XII-4" class="fnanchor">XII-4</a> It appears, therefore,
that the ultimate check to population is lack
of food, due to the fact that population increases
faster than food supply. Nature, in other words,
sets a harsher law over the increase of subsistence
than she does over the birth rate. Man fails to
take cognizance of this law and brings untold
misery upon himself. The lower economic classes
are the chief victims, and the giants of poverty and
pauperism rule over whole sections of human population.
Malthus considers the question of population
the fundamental social problem.</p>

<p>Since population outruns food supply, dire human
consequences naturally follow. Food supply, as a
check upon population, operates harshly; it is but
representative of an entire series of rigorous
natural, or positive, checks upon population. In
this list there are unwholesome occupations;
forms of severe labor; extreme poverty; damp and
wretched housing conditions; diseases, epidemics,
plagues, poor nursing; intestine commotion, martial
law, civil war; wars of all forms; excesses of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
kinds.<a id="FNanchor_XII-5" href="#Footnote_XII-5" class="fnanchor">XII-5</a> These positive checks upon population are
the results of two main causes, namely, vice and
misery. As a result of the operation of these factors,
population is being continually cut down and
kept near the mere subsistence plane.</p>

<p>Malthus pointed out another check upon population,
the preventive. The fear of falling into
poverty causes many young people to postpone
marriage until they can safely marry—economically.
This check so far as voluntary is peculiar
to man and, to the extent that it is not followed
by irregular sex gratification, is prudential. The
actual pressure of population upon food supply, or
the fear of this impingement, prevents people from
marrying earlier than they do and from reproducing
their kind faster than they would do otherwise.
This pressure, or the fear of it, cuts down
the marriage rate in times of economic depression.
But let prosperity come and the marriage rate leaps
upward, especially among the poorer classes.</p>

<p>The positive and preventive checks upon population
hold a definite relation to each other. “In
every country where the whole of the procreative
power cannot be called into action, the preventive
and the positive checks must vary inversely as each
other.”<a id="FNanchor_XII-6" href="#Footnote_XII-6" class="fnanchor">XII-6</a> That is to say, when positive checks, such
as famine and war, slay large numbers of people,
moral restraint is diminished and the population
numbers rapidly increase. When the preventive
check expresses itself strongly, the population is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
kept down numerically, and positive checks, such as
famine or even war, are defeated.</p>

<p>Malthus attempted to establish three propositions:</p>

<p>(1) The limitation of population by the restriction
of the means of subsistence.</p>

<p>(2) The invariable increase of population whenever
the means of subsistence increase, unless prevented
by powerful checks.</p>

<p>(3) The factors which keep population on a level
with the means of subsistence are all resolvable into
three: moral restraint, vice, and misery.<a id="FNanchor_XII-7" href="#Footnote_XII-7" class="fnanchor">XII-7</a></p>

<p>No one can gainsay the importance or the seriousness
of the problem of population. Plato wrestled
with it, and urged that procreation when it goes
on too fast or too slow should be regulated by the
state—through a proper distribution of marks of
ignominy or of honor. The number of marriages
should be determined by the magistrates.</p>

<p>Aristotle suggested that the ages of marriage for
both sexes should be regulated; he even advocated
the regulation of the number of children for each
marriage. Additional children should be aborted.</p>

<p>Malthus, however, was wiser than either Plato
or Aristotle, for he observed that the cause which
has the most lasting effect in improving the condition
of the poorer classes is the conduct and prudence
of the individuals themselves.<a id="FNanchor_XII-8" href="#Footnote_XII-8" class="fnanchor">XII-8</a> Malthus asserted
that it is in the power of each individual to
avoid all the evil consequences to himself and society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
which result from the principle of population,
“by the practice of a virtue clearly dictated to him
by the light of nature and expressly enjoined in
revealed religion.”<a id="FNanchor_XII-9" href="#Footnote_XII-9" class="fnanchor">XII-9</a></p>

<p>Malthus demonstrated clearly the weakness of
liberal poor-laws. Give more food to the poor, and
they will produce more children, and suffer more
misery. Poor-laws increase the numbers of children
of the poor, and hence increase the amount of
misery. Both private benevolence and poor-laws
increase the number of marriages and of children.<a id="FNanchor_XII-10" href="#Footnote_XII-10" class="fnanchor">XII-10</a></p>

<p>Education is the solution which Malthus demanded.<a id="FNanchor_XII-11" href="#Footnote_XII-11" class="fnanchor">XII-11</a>
Educate the poor to postpone marriage,
to keep the birth rate down, and to practice economic
thrift. To a great extent education will
secure the operation of the prudential check upon
population. The science of moral and political
philosophy should not be confined within such narrow
limits that it is unable to overcome in practical
ways the obstacles to human happiness which arise
from the law of population.<a id="FNanchor_XII-12" href="#Footnote_XII-12" class="fnanchor">XII-12</a></p>

<p>There are factors in the population situation
which did not exist at the time of Malthus, or which
he did not see. Today there are additional preventive
checks upon population, for example, the rise
of democracy in the family whereby the wife and
mother no longer is dominated by the husband and
father, but has a voice of her own regarding domestic
matters, such as the number of children. Closely
related to this tendency is the feminist movement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
or woman’s rights movement, whereby women are
demanding that they not be confined to the sphere
of bearing and rearing children. Increasing intelligence
and foresight has served as a powerful preventive
check upon population. The current emphasis
upon luxury is inimical to the birth rate. A
higher economic status almost uniformly cuts down
the birth rate. Within the last score of years the
new science of eugenics has attracted widespread
attention. Eugenics stresses quality of population.
It would effect a decrease in the numbers of children
born among the lower classes, among the
poorer stocks, and prevent procreation among the
mentally deficient. It would increase the birth rate
among the cultured and the high grade stocks.</p>

<p>Malthus appreciated the dependence of urban
population upon rural districts, but he could not
foresee the degree to which cities would grow in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The relative
decrease of agricultural labor and the proportional
increase in non-agricultural labor has thrown a
burden upon the food supply which even Malthus
could not forecast.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Malthus did not realize the
extent to which new countries such as the United
States, Canada, Australia, Argentina would contribute
to the world’s means of subsistence. He
could not predict the way in which invention would
be applied in solving agricultural problems, and
how today one man with improved machinery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
intensive methods can produce a hundred ears of
corn where one was produced a century ago.
Nevertheless, the “new country” argument against
Malthus’ principle of population is ultimately fallacious,
for new countries soon become old, the supply
of new countries becomes exhausted, and there
is even a limit to soil productiveness. The very
pressure of population against means of subsistence
is, however, a cause of inventiveness, so that unanticipated
increases in food supply may occur at
any time.</p>

<p>Socialism has criticized Malthus severely. Socialism
holds that at a given time the food supply
is sufficient to meet human needs but that it is
poorly or unjustly distributed. With just distribution
of the returns from industry, food supply
would not impinge strongly on population. But
socialism might greatly endanger the prudential
check on population, and hence result in an increased
birth rate; which in turn would more than
balance any release from human misery that a
just distribution of the returns from industry would
effect.</p>

<p>Another point which Malthus did not observe is
that the increase in technical skill which comes with
vocational education is overcome by the tendency of
the world’s population to overtake the world’s food
productiveness. With increase in population, the
price of land rises, the rent for land increases, the
cost of living mounts upward, and the purchasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
power of the dollar, or its equivalent, declines.</p>

<p>Some of the followers of Malthus have advocated
birth control as an artificial means of regulating
population. Birth control prevents by physical
means the birth of children. It is a useful weapon
against sexually brutal husbands. It does not provide
for self control or moral control of the sexual
impulses. It encourages rather than controls gratification
of the sexual desires. By it a gain is made
in protecting helpless women and in cutting down
the birth rate among the lower moral classes,
whether wealthy or poor, but the gain is more than
lost by the opportunity which birth control gives to
the irregular gratification of sexual impulses and
by the resultant weakening of moral fibre.</p>

<p>Thomas N. Carver, whose work will be referred
to again in subsequent chapters, has developed an
interesting population theory which is partly Malthusian.<a id="FNanchor_XII-13" href="#Footnote_XII-13" class="fnanchor">XII-13</a>
The increase in population from both
immigration sources and the birth rate should be
cut down, thereby decreasing the percentage of unskilled
labor. Further, persons should be trained
out of the unskilled group into the skilled group and
then into the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrepreneur</i> class. Thus, by greatly
decreasing the number of unskilled laborers and by
increasing the number of entrepreneurs, wages
will advance and profits will be increasingly subdivided.
The poor will become well-to-do, and
poverty as it is now known will tend to disappear.
This theory underestimates the importance of psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
motives and of social attitudes under a
system where a marked degree of competition is
encouraged.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be stated that the principle
of population as given by Malthus is fundamental
to an understanding of the problems of social
progress.<a id="FNanchor_XII-14" href="#Footnote_XII-14" class="fnanchor">XII-14</a> There is a positive relation between
population and means of subsistence. Positive and
preventive checks upon population are continually
at work. Moral restraint and self control, based
on scientifically devised human laws, create a better
moral fibre than birth control. The quality of personality
is far more important than mere numbers
of population. The struggle for quality in personality
must be supplemented by justice in industrial
and social processes before the population problem
can be solved.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Comte and Positive Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>An organized foundation for the field of social
thought was not laid until near the close of the
first half of the nineteenth century. At that time
Auguste Comte (1798–1857) gave at least an organized
groundwork, if not a synthetic introduction
to sociology. He was the first to stake out the
territory of social thought, to show the relation of
social thought to other fields of knowledge, and to
separate social statics from social dynamics. He
was the first important social philosopher, and his
<i>Positive Philosophy</i> the first treatise roughly to
outline the field of sociology.</p>

<p>Auguste Comte invented the term, sociology, by
which he meant the science of human association.
While he did not contribute much to the science
itself, he laid important foundation stones. He reacted
against all forms of loose thinking about man,
rejected metaphysical and theological speculations,
and insisted upon the observation and classification
of social phenomena. He repudiated attempts to
discover causes of social uniformities, and coined
the name, positivism, for the philosophical system
upon which he founded sociology. The bases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
positivism may be found in the ideas of Bacon,
Galileo, and Descartes. As each of these three men
broke with tradition and sought observed facts
in their respective fields, so Comte was likewise
prompted to do in the field of social thought.</p>

<p>Auguste Comte was born at Montpelier, France,
the son of humble and law-abiding Catholic parents.
At the age of nine he displayed unusual mental
ability, a strong character, and a tendency to defy
authority. He is described as brilliant and recalcitrant.
He possessed a wonderful memory and a
remarkable avidity for reading. In school he won
many prizes, and took a position of leadership
among his fellow students, who called him “the
philosopher.” At the age of sixteen he was devoting
his energies and abilities to the study of
mathematics.</p>

<p>As a youth Comte demanded the resignation of
one of his instructors, criticized Napoleon, and disregarded
both ecclesiastical and parental authority.
He especially enjoyed to point out the stupidity of
his superiors and to oppose tyranny.</p>

<p>At the age of nineteen Comte made the acquaintance
of Saint Simon, the well-known socialist. The
friendship lasted for only a few years, but long
enough to exert a deep influence upon the youthful
mathematician. Saint Simon (1760–1825) had indicated
the need for a scientific classification of the
sciences with political science at the head of the list,
and had developed a new fraternalism under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
name of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le nouveau Christianisme</i>. This system
was optimistic and humanitarian, but dreamy.
Comte was dissatisfied with it, and undertook to
work out a better scheme of social analysis and
organization.</p>

<p>In 1822, Comte’s first important work was
published. It contained an introduction by Saint
Simon, and was entitled <i>A Prospectus of the Scientific
Works Required for the Reorganization of
Society</i>. It represented an important beginning
of the task on which Comte was to spend his life.
Upon the problem Comte read and worked assiduously,
save as he was interrupted by an unhappy
married life and by mental aberrations, due to
overwork. He gave courses of public lectures, but
insisted upon working gratuituously. He would
not accept royalties from the sale of his books,
despite the fact that he lived continually on the
verge of starvation. His friends, however, made
him gifts and established a subsidy. He insisted
upon the rule that all his literary productions
should be given to the public gratuitously.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-1" href="#Footnote_XIII-1" class="fnanchor">XIII-1</a></p>

<p>His method of composition has been commented
upon by his biographers. As a result of his unusual
memory and the high degree of mental concentration
to which he attained, he was able to plan chapters
and volumes in their smallest details, and then
from memory to put them into written form. This
method enabled him to secure “an extraordinary
unity of conception and organic symmetry of plan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>Comte manifested an unusual regard for the
truth. This attitude required him to modify and
qualify statements of fundamental principles at
great length. As a result his works are often
tedious reading. He preferred, however, to write
meticulously and thus to safeguard truth, rather
than speak in epigrams and sacrifice truth.</p>

<p>Comte’s two leading works are: the <i>Positive
Philosophy</i> and the <i>Positive Polity</i>. The first appeared
in six volumes during the years from 1830
to 1842. The second work, in four volumes, was
published in the years from 1851 to 1854. It is not
the equal of the <i>Positive Philosophy</i>, which was
translated into English in 1853 by Harriet Martineau.</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill has referred to Comte as among
the first of European thinkers; and, by his institution
of a new social science, in some respects the
first.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-2" href="#Footnote_XIII-2" class="fnanchor">XIII-2</a> George Henry Lewes called Comte the
greatest of modern thinkers. John Morley, the
English statesman and author, says of Comte:
“Neither Franklin, nor any man that has ever lived,
could surpass him in the heroic tenacity with which,
in the face of a thousand obstacles, he pursued his
own ideal of a vocation.” Harriet Martineau summarizes
his methods as follows: “There can be
no question but that his whole career was one of
the most intense concentration of mind, gigantic
industry, rigid economy, and singular punctuality
and exactness in all his habits.”<a id="FNanchor_XIII-3" href="#Footnote_XIII-3" class="fnanchor">XIII-3</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>In laying the foundations for a new social science,
Comte began with an analysis of types of
thinking. (1) Primitive and untrained persons
everywhere think in supernatural terms. They suppose
that all physical phenomena are caused by the
immediate action of capricious supernatural beings.
The primitive man believes in all kinds of fetishes
in which spirits or supernatural beings live. Fetishism
admitted of no priesthood, because its gods
are individual, each residing in fixed objects.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-4" href="#Footnote_XIII-4" class="fnanchor">XIII-4</a></p>

<p>As the mind of primitive man became better organized,
fetishism became cumbersome. Too many
fetishes produced mental confusion. A coalescence
of gods resulted and polytheism arose. The polytheistic
gods represented different phases of life.
This state in human thought is well illustrated by
the Homeric gods.</p>

<p>But a large number of capricious divinities are
mentally unsatisfactory. They create mental contradictions.
Consequently, the gods are arranged
in a hierarchy. Finally, the idea of one God, or of
monotheism, developed. The belief arose that
every phenomenon is produced by the immediate
action of the one God. As man’s vision widened
and his observations increased in scope and depth,
the concept of a monotheistic universe became
clarified. Monotheism is the climax of the theological
stage of thinking.</p>

<p>But rationalism argues that God does not stand
directly behind every phenomenon. Pure reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
insists that God is a First Cause or an Abstract
Being. Pure reason speaks in terms of inalienable
rights: metaphysical explanations, however, are unsatisfactory
to the mind.</p>

<p>Hence, Comte developed his concept of positivism,
which is a purely intellectual way of looking
at the world. Comte held that the mind should concentrate
on the observation and classification of
phenomena. He believed that both theological and
metaphysical speculations, as he used the terms,
were as likely to be fiction as truth, and that there
is no way of determining which is the case. Thus
it will be more profitable if the individual should
direct his thoughts to the lines of thinking which
are most truly prolific, namely, to observation and
classification of data.</p>

<p>Comte even took the position that it is futile to
try to determine causes. We can observe uniformities,
or laws, but it is mere speculation to assign
causes to these uniformities. Positivism deified
observation and classification of data. Its weaknesses
should not hinder the student, however,
from seeing the importance of its emphasis upon
the scientific procedure of observing and classifying
data in an age when dogmatism and speculation
were rife.</p>

<p>The three stages of thought which Comte described
are not three levels of thought, as Comte
contended, but, as Herbert Spencer indicated, they
may represent the same plane of thinking. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
requires about the same degree of thinking ability.
Moreover, as John Fiske argued, the three methods
of approach to problems are often pursued simultaneously
by a given person. Some phenomena are
explained theologically; others, metaphysically; and
others, positively.</p>

<p>A second main contribution which Comte made
to social thought is that each of the three modes
of thinking determines and corresponds to a type
of social organization. Speaking from the standpoint
of his own religious contacts, he declared
that theological thinking leads to a military and
monarchial social organization, with God at the
head of the hierarchy as King of kings and a
mighty warrior, and with human beings arranged
in a military organization. Divine sanction rules.
As expressed through the human leaders, this divine
sanction must not be questioned. Dogmatism
must be meekly endured, or else its threatened punishments
will be turned loose upon helpless offenders.
Divine rights rule.</p>

<p>Metaphysical thinking produces a government
dominated by doctrines of abstract rights. Natural
rights are substituted for divine rights. A
priesthood is furthered. Social organization becomes
legalistic, formal, structural, without adequate
content.</p>

<p>Positive thinking produces practical results in
the form of industrial enterprises, and ushers in an
industrial age. It inquires into the nature and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
utilization of natural forces. It transforms the
material resources of the earth, and produces material
inventions.</p>

<p>Comte failed to postulate a fourth mode of thinking,
namely, socialized thinking, or a system of
thought which would emphasize not simply the use
of natural forces, but the use of natural forces for
social ends, for the purpose of building constructive,
just, and harmonious societies, and of developing
personalities who will evaluate life in terms of
the welfare of other personalities. Comte, however,
should be credited with opening the way for
the rise of socialized thinking.</p>

<p>A third phase of Comte’s system was his classification
of the sciences, with sociology as the latest
and greatest of the group. The Greek thinkers,
it will be recalled, undertook to classify all knowledge
under three headings: physics, ethics, and
politics. Bacon made the divisions correlative to
the so-called mental faculties of memory, imagination,
and reason, namely: history, poetry, and
science.</p>

<p>Comte chose as his principle of classifying
knowledge, the order of increasing dependence. He
arranged the sciences so that each category may
be grounded on the principal laws of the preceding
category, and serve as a basis for the next ensuing
category.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-5" href="#Footnote_XIII-5" class="fnanchor">XIII-5</a> The order, hence, is one of increasing
complexity and decreasing generality. The most
simple phenomena must be the most general—general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
in the sense of being everywhere present.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-6" href="#Footnote_XIII-6" class="fnanchor">XIII-6</a></p>

<p>Comte began with mathematics, the tool of the
mind. Accurate thinking is always done in terms
of mathematics. With mathematics as its chief
tool, the mind of man can go anywhere in its thinking.
Mathematics is the most powerful instrument
which the mind may use in the investigation
of natural laws.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-7" href="#Footnote_XIII-7" class="fnanchor">XIII-7</a></p>

<p>Mathematics is not a constituent member of the
group of sciences. It is the basis of them all. It
holds the first place in the hierarchy of the sciences,
and is the best point of departure in all education,
whether general or special.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-8" href="#Footnote_XIII-8" class="fnanchor">XIII-8</a> It is the oldest and
most perfect of all the sciences.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-9" href="#Footnote_XIII-9" class="fnanchor">XIII-9</a></p>

<p>Mathematics is the science which measures precisely
the relations between objects and ideas. It
is <em>the</em> science.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-10" href="#Footnote_XIII-10" class="fnanchor">XIII-10</a> The Greeks had no other. Its definition
is the definition of all science. Its function
is that of ascertaining relationships, a process
which is basic to scientific thinking in all fields.
Education that is based on any other method is
faulty, inexact, and unreliable. It is only through
mathematics that we can understand science.</p>

<p>The highest form of mathematics is calculus.
There is no scientific inquiry in which calculus is
not used. Even the physician in prescribing for the
cure of a disease, must provide for the mixing together
of different quantities of different medicines,
so that, when taken at determined intervals of time,
they will possess the right qualities for bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the human body back to its normal state. Calculus
is the branch of science which has the highest intellectual
dignity. In it the proportion of reasoning
to observation is greater than elsewhere.</p>

<p>With mathematics as the tool, the classification
of knowledge may proceed. All natural phenomena
fall into two grand divisions: inorganic and organic.
The inorganic are more general and should
be considered first. Inorganic phenomena are of
two classes: astronomical and terrestrial. Astronomical
phenomena are the most general of all.
The stars and planets appear under the least varied
aspects.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-12" href="#Footnote_XIII-12" class="fnanchor">XIII-12</a> Astronomy is the science by which the
movements of the heavenly bodies, including the
earth, are measured. How can we thoroughly understand
any terrestrial phenomena without considering
the nature of the earth and its relation to
the other units of the solar system?<a id="FNanchor_XIII-13" href="#Footnote_XIII-13" class="fnanchor">XIII-13</a></p>

<p>Terrestrial physics includes two fields: physics
proper and chemistry. Material bodies may be regarded
in either their physical or chemical aspects.
Physics is more general than chemistry; it deals
with masses rather than elements. Chemical phenomena
depend upon the laws of physics, without
being influenced by them in turn. Chemical action
is conditioned by the laws of weight, heat, electricity.
The study of inorganic phenomena thus
falls under three scientific heads: astronomy, physics,
and chemistry.</p>

<p>Organic phenomena include two types: individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
and group. The first refers to the function and
structure of all individual forms in the plant and
animal worlds. It is general physiology, or, in
modern terms, biology. It involves the study of
all life and the general laws pertaining to the individual
units of life.</p>

<p>Biology rests on chemistry, because it is in chemistry
that all reliable knowledge about nutrition or
secretion is found. Biology is indebted to physics
for knowledge concerning the weight of, temperature
of, and related facts about living organisms.
Biological laws are partially determined by
astronomical factors. If the earth were to rotate
faster than it does, the course of physiological phenomena
would be accelerated, and the length of life
would be shortened.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-14" href="#Footnote_XIII-14" class="fnanchor">XIII-14</a> If the orbit of the earth
were to become as eccentric as that of a comet,
changes of a fatal nature would occur to all
life on the earth. If there were no inclination of
the earth’s axis, the seasons would be unknown,
and the geographical distribution of living species
would be vastly different from the present situation.
All accurate work in biological studies is
mathematical in character. Thus biology, the science
of organic phenomena, is dependent on all the
preceding divisions on the scale of knowledge.</p>

<p>The study of gregarious or associative life is a
special field. Comte called this science social
physics, and for it invented the specific term, sociology.
It rests in turn upon biological, chemical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
physical, astronomical knowledge and uses mathematics
as its tool. Comte virtually defines six sciences:
mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry,
biology, and sociology. He treats of transcendental
biology, which is the basis of modern psychology.
Comte urged that no science could be effectually
studied without competent knowledge concerning
the sciences on which it depends. It is necessary
not only to have a general knowledge of all the
sciences but that they should be studied in order—this
is Comte’s dictum to the student of sociology.
Comte insisted that one general science could not
develop beyond a given point until the preceding
science has passed a given stage.</p>

<p>Each of the six general sciences has passed
through the three stages of thought. Mathematics,
which has advanced furthest into the positive stage,
is still connected with superstition, such as that
which hovers round the number 13. The other
general sciences are less further along. Sociology,
the latest science to develop, Comte hoped by his
works to push over into the positive stage.</p>

<p>Comte divided sociology, or social physics, into
social statics and social dynamics. Social statics
is the study of the laws of action and reaction of
the different parts of the social order, aside for
the time being from the general social movements
which are modifying them.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-15" href="#Footnote_XIII-15" class="fnanchor">XIII-15</a> Social dynamics considers
the laws of progress. Social statics inquires
into the laws of co-existence of social phenomena;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
social dynamics examines the laws of social succession.
Sociology is the study of social organization
and of social progress.</p>

<p>Society is in a state of anarchy. Individuals
with the best of purposes are continually weakening
the efforts of each other. Powerful persons
are crushing the weak. The defeated are conniving
against the strong. Why all this social anarchy?
To Comte the answer is clear. Behind moral and
social anarchy there is intellectual anarchy. People
do not have a knowledge of the fundamental
laws of social order and social progress.</p>

<p>Moreover, people fail to appreciate the necessity
of knowledge of social laws. They are insensible
to the value of sound social theory. They want
nothing but the “practical,” unmindful of the fact
that the “practical” is as likely to be based on incorrect
social theory as upon sound social conceptions.</p>

<p>The necessity of fundamental concepts concerning
society underlies social organization. In the
absence of these general ideas, there is “no other
daily resource for the maintenance of even a rough
and precarious social order than an appeal, more
or less immediate, to personal interests.”<a id="FNanchor_XIII-16" href="#Footnote_XIII-16" class="fnanchor">XIII-16</a> In the
absence of a moral authority, the material order
requires the use of either terror or corruption; the
latter is less inconvenient and more in accordance
with the nature of modern society.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-17" href="#Footnote_XIII-17" class="fnanchor">XIII-17</a> Moreover,
politicians and other public men work against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
elaboration of the social theory which is necessary
for the salvation of society. They sneer at the
development of social science. Many of those who
occupy the chief political stations regard with antipathy
the true reorganization of society. Social
principles are not even sought. On the other hand,
social charlatanism attracts by the magnificence of
its promises and dazzles by its transient successes.
Comte deplored attempts to re-make society
through institutionalism, regardless of social theory.
He stressed the fundamental importance of
social principles as the only means of guaranteeing
a correct institutional procedure. As a practical
principle of social adjustment, Comte endorsed the
Catholic ideal: In necessary things, unity; in doubtful
things, liberty; in all things, charity.</p>

<p>Comte protested vigorously against materialism.
He pointed out that for three centuries the best
minds had been devoted to material science and had
neglected societary problems.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-18" href="#Footnote_XIII-18" class="fnanchor">XIII-18</a> Material institutions
should be modified and made to harmonize
with the underlying laws of social evolution. A
moral reorganization of society must precede and
direct the material and political reorganization.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-19" href="#Footnote_XIII-19" class="fnanchor">XIII-19</a></p>

<p>Social improvement is a result of mental development.
This development favors the preponderance
of the noblest human tendencies. Prevision and
science when applied to society will bring out the
best phases of human nature, and thus result in
social improvement. Although the lower instincts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
will continue to manifest themselves in modified
action, their less sustained exercise will debilitate
them by degrees.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-20" href="#Footnote_XIII-20" class="fnanchor">XIII-20</a></p>

<p>The three chief causes of social variation result
from, first, race; second, climate; and third, political
action in its whole scientific content. The first
and second factors cannot be changed greatly, but
the political influences are wide open to modification
by social prevision. In this connection sociology
finds its manifestation.</p>

<p>With the development of society, intellectual activity
and gregariousness slowly overcome the preponderance
of the affective over the intellectual
phases of life. But even in the best natures the personally
affective elements are more powerful than
the social affections. Real intellectual development,
however, will strengthen man’s empire over his
passions, refine his gregariousness, and release his
energies for social activities.</p>

<p>Comte makes the family the social unit. Man
cannot live in isolation, but the family can survive
by itself.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-21" href="#Footnote_XIII-21" class="fnanchor">XIII-21</a> The striking characteristic of domestic
organization is its establishment of the elementary
idea of social perpetuity, by directly and irresistibly
connecting the future with the past.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-22" href="#Footnote_XIII-22" class="fnanchor">XIII-22</a> Family life
will always be the school of social life, both for
obedience and for command.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-23" href="#Footnote_XIII-23" class="fnanchor">XIII-23</a> Comte failed to
escape the logic of the patriarchal family life. He
did credit women, however, with being superior to
men in the spontaneous expansion of sympathy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
sociality, although inferior in understanding and
reason.</p>

<p>The direction of social evolution is toward further
development of the noblest dispositions and the
most generous feelings, and away from the expression
of the animal appetites and the material desires.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-24" href="#Footnote_XIII-24" class="fnanchor">XIII-24</a>
The trend is from the satisfaction of the
selfish impulses to the habitual exercise of the social
impulses. Happiness depends on the presence of
new stimuli in one’s form of activity. A life of
labor that is full of constructive stimuli is after all
the fittest to develop personality.</p>

<p>Comte was the friend of popular education.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-25" href="#Footnote_XIII-25" class="fnanchor">XIII-25</a> He
based his contention on the invariable homogeneity
of the human mind. The minds of people of all
races are potentially similar. All members of the
race are capable of development to a common plane.</p>

<p>In his <i>Positive Polity</i>, Comte made important
changes in his thinking. This work was the product
of his later years, and shows the effects of
deprivation and struggle. It is inferior in quality
to his earlier treatise on <i>Positive Philosophy</i>. It is
a question, therefore, how far his later ideas should
be permitted to supersede his thinking when he was
in his prime. In his later thought-life he receded
from his emphasis upon the intellectual nature and
stressed the importance of the affections. He made
affection the central point of life and developed the
concept of love. We tire of thinking and even of
acting, he asserted, but we never tire of loving.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-26" href="#Footnote_XIII-26" class="fnanchor">XIII-26</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>The Comtean ideal became a disinterested love of
mankind. Comte developed a religion of humanity.
His contact with Christianity gave him the belief
that it is chiefly ecclesiastical. He did not see in
Christianity a social keynote. Hence, he attempted
to create a purely social religion. He made mankind
an end in itself; he failed to see that human
society is probably an outcropping of universal
purpose.</p>

<p>If we judge Comte by his own time and age, we
shall see the importance of his contributions to
social thought, which were as follows: 1. There
is need for accurate thinking about society. Mathematics
is the best tool for obtaining social accuracy.
2. Comte developed positivism with its emphasis
upon observation and classification of social data.
3. Knowledge has scientific divisions, according
to the principles of increasing dependence and decreasing
generality. This scale begins with mathematics
and astronomy, includes physics, chemistry,
biology, in order, and ends with the social sciences,
particularly sociology. 4. Sociology deals with
the static and dynamic phases of human association.
5. Comte developed a humanitarian philosophy.
6. Comte insisted on an intellectual understanding
of social processes as the only true basis for overcoming
social anarchy and for solving the problems
of society.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Marx and Socialistic Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Socialism proper had its beginning in the second
and third decades of the nineteenth century. It developed
primarily in continental Europe and in
England. Although Plato’s communism and More’s
utopianism were forerunners of socialism, the social
unrest in Europe in the early years of the nineteenth
century was the direct causal factor. Socialism
also represented a reaction against the prevailing
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> thought regarding the evils of
society and the suffering of the poorer classes.</p>

<p>Socialism began with the concepts and experiments
of Saint Simon and Fourier in France, of
Robert Owen in England, and of Rodbertus, Lassalle,
Marx, and Engels in Germany. In France
the movement was carried forward by Proudhon
and Blanc; and in England by the Christian socialists,
chiefly Maurice and Kingsley. In Germany,
Marx maintained the position of leadership for
many decades, and finally became the best known
exponent of socialist thought in the world.</p>

<p>In his <i>New Christianity</i>, Saint Simon, who was
referred to in the preceding chapter, made a unique
contribution to social thought. His thinking was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
not deep, or systematic, but characterized by ingenuity.
Saint Simon advocated a society in which
only useful things are produced. In this industrial
order, men of science will be in control. Saint
Simon was greatly interested in the welfare of the
poorest classes. His <i>New Christianity</i> was essentially
a plea that the whole world devote itself to
the improvment of the living conditions of the very
poor. The influence which Saint Simon had upon
Comte has already been mentioned.</p>

<p>Another important socialistic ideal was developed
by Fourier (1772–1837), who worked out a social
system in which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">phalange</i> is the chief instrument
in securing a perfect society. The phalange
is composed of from twenty-four to thirty-two
groups of people. Each group comprises from
seven to nine individuals. The unifying bond is
natural attraction, or free elective love and sympathy.
The members of each phalange live communistically
in a large commodious structure called
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">phalanstère</i>. The phalanges were to unite in one
large world federation, with headquarters at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The people work according to their interests, frequently
changing occupations. The products of
labor are subdivided; a minimum goes equally to
all, irrespective of any conditioning factors; of the
remainder five-twelfths goes to labor, three-twelfths
to special ability, and four-twelfths to
capital. Difficult common labor is paid the most,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
on the assumption that he who does pleasant labor
receives pay in mental ways. Every individual
should have an opportunity to become a capitalist;
and every woman should be enabled to become independent
economically. These utopian plans of
Fourier called for a sudden and complete transformation
of human nature. They underestimated
the force of human selfishness.</p>

<p>Socialistic thought was carried into politics by
Louis Blanc (1811–1882). He declared that no
genuine reformation of society could take place
until political machinery was organized democratically.
The democratic state would endow national
workshops. These workshops would be operated
by industrial associations composed of workingmen,
who would elect their own officers, regulate their
own industries, and provide for the distribution of
the returns from industry. Once started by the
state these industrial associations will expand and
increase in number until the whole nation, and then
the world, will be organized in this way.</p>

<p>Blanc participated in the French Revolution of
1848 and became a member of the provisional government.
His national workshop idea failed in
practice. His enemies were partly responsible for
this defeat, because the essentials of productive
work and guarantees of character which Blanc
urged were disregarded. The fact, however, that
these two essentials were considered necessary for
the successful development of national workshops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
indicates that the system, under average conditions,
might not be a success.</p>

<p>Nearly all the early socialists were evolutionists
rather than revolutionists. They did not advocate
class struggle theories. They developed bourgeois
rather than proletariat ideas. An outstanding exception
to these statements is found in the radical
attitude of Babeuf (1760–1797), who was essentially
a forerunner of Marxian socialism and also
of the anarchistic philosophy of Proudhon and
Bakunin. Babeuf vigorously proclaimed the sovereignty
of the proletariat, and advocated the abolition
of inheritance laws and of private property.
He urged that the property of corporations be confiscated,
and that a communistic state be established.</p>

<p>The well-known principles of justice, liberty, and
equality were utilized by Proudhon (1809–1865), a
philosophic anarchist. He would have the same
wages paid to an unskilled workman as to a successful
business or professional man. He predicted
that equalization of opportunity would bring about
an equalization of ability.</p>

<p>Proudhon attacked property rights. He declared
that property is theft. In itself property is lifeless,
but it nevertheless demands rent, interest, or profits,
or all three. It protects itself behind law, and
in order to guarantee its alleged rights, it calls out
the militia, evicts families, and takes bread from
the mouths of little children. It robs labor of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
just returns.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-1" href="#Footnote_XIV-1" class="fnanchor">XIV-1</a></p>

<p>By unsatisfactory reasoning Proudhon urged the
free development of individuals in society, whereby
each individual would learn to govern himself so
well in society that government would no longer
be needed. This theory is Proudhon’s concept of
anarchy. In this doctrine Proudhon neglects to
provide an adequate dynamic or to foresee the ultimate
complexity of human relations.</p>

<p>In England, Robert Owen (1771–1858) became
a founder of socialism. As a factory manager,
Owen developed social ideas. Living in an age of
long hours, woman and child labor of the worst
forms, and deplorable housing conditions, Owen
deserves the credit of inaugurating a twentieth century
program of welfare work. It was Owen’s
theory that the workingman is so subject to his
environment that even his character is determined
for him. Owen attempted in theory and practice
to prevent the impingement of the economic environment
upon the workers. He believed in self-governing
organizations of labor. He inaugurated
the co-operative movement as a means of securing
industrial justice and of giving the workingman a
chance at the free development of his personality.</p>

<p>Owen objected to Malthus’ doctrine of population
on the ground that it failed to consider the
marvelous increase in the means of subsistence
which might come from the application of inventive
genius to the sources of the food supply. He also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
protested against the Malthusian argument for the
restriction of population, because this argument did
not give due weight to the unjust distribution of
wealth and to the enslaving social organization to
which labor is subject.</p>

<p>Owen’s experiments, particularly at New Harmony,
Indiana, demonstrated that a communistic
organization of society in itself cannot save society.
The strength of Owen’s social thought lay in its
accentuation of the need for providing labor with
opportunities of industrial initiative and co-operation.</p>

<p>During the middle of the nineteenth century in
England, the Christian socialists flourished. The
founders of this movement were Frederick Maurice
and Charles Kingsley. These men were clergymen
who became greatly interested in the welfare
of the working classes. They made clear the evils
of the prevailing economic order, the formality of
the Manchester school of economics, and proposed
to apply the principles of Christianity to the economic
system of the day. They opposed economic
competition. For this method they urged the substitution
of the ethical and spiritual principles of
co-operation and love in industrial relationships—for
both employer and employee in all their dealings
with each other. Their socialism is essentially a
vigorous application of Christian love to every-day
relationships.</p>

<p>The influence of Christian socialism strengthened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the experiment of the Rochdale weavers who in
1844 had organized a consumers’ co-operative society.
The concept of consumers’ co-operation received
its original impetus from the thought and
practice of Robert Owen, achieved a measurable
degree of concreteness under the efforts of the
Rochdale weavers, and through Maurice and Kingsley
won the assistance of Christianity.</p>

<p>In Germany, Rodbertus, Lassalle, Marx and
Engels molded the thinking of socialists about the
nature of human society. Rodbertus (1805–1875),
the son of a university professor, was a quiet, deep
thinker about social processes. According to his
analysis of social development, three stages may be
pointed out. The first was marked by slavery, or
by private property in human beings. The second
state is an indirect form of the first, namely, one
of private property in land and capital. Through
this type of ownership the economically fortunate
or shrewd are able to exercise widespread power
over the unfortunate and the uneducated. In the
third state, toward which society is trending, the
concept of service will rule, and private property
as a dominant concept will be compelled to take a
thoroughly subordinate place in human activities.
The ultimate goal, according to Rodbertus, is a
world communist society, with land and capital as
national property, and with labor rewarded according
to its productiveness.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-2" href="#Footnote_XIV-2" class="fnanchor">XIV-2</a></p>

<p>Rodbertus denied the validity of the wages fund<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
theory and argued that wages are not paid by capital;
it is that part of the productive earnings of
labor which labor receives. His fundamental thesis
is that labor is the source and measure of all value.
He advocated an evolutionary procedure whereby
the state should pass legislation that would guarantee
just returns to labor. This form of state
socialism is to be gradually developed, until a scientific
socialism is reached with its emphasis upon a
government of labor, for labor, and by labor.</p>

<p>The founder of Social Democracy in Germany,
Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864), wrote two significant
treatises, the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bastiat-Schulze</i> and the
<i>Working Men’s Programme</i>. Lassalle believed
that natural conditions are productive of misery
and vice, and that it is the chief business of the
state to extricate men from this thraldom. The
state should provide means for lifting the laboring
man to a level of industrial freedom.</p>

<p>Lassalle objected to the theory known as the iron
law of wages. He protested against the smallness
of the share of his earnings which the laborer
really receives. He advocated the establishment of
productive associations wherein labor might perform
the double function of workman and capitalist.
In order that these productive associations
might be started, the state should advance funds.
After the productive associations have secured momentum
they will continue by virtue of their own
strength. Ultimately, industry will be conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
exclusively through productive associations; both
industrial and social democracy will finally rule in
political life. Lassalle became the founder of the
Social Democratic party in Germany. Lassalle
boldly denounced the reactionary classes that were
in political power in his time and led the workers
in a movement to overthrow the existing social
order.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-3" href="#Footnote_XIV-3" class="fnanchor">XIV-3</a></p>

<p>The name of Karl Marx (1818–1883) is supreme
on the list of socialists. Marx was born in Germany
of Jewish parents, and educated at the universities
of Bonn and Berlin. He became a journalist,
but the paper which he edited was considered
too liberal and was suppressed. Marx went to
Paris in 1842, where he continued editorial work.
At this time he was influenced by French socialism
and its leader, Proudhon. In 1845, he was expelled
from Paris at the request of the Prussian government.
He went to Brussels. In the meantime a
deep friendship with Friedrich Engels (1820–1895)
had been established.</p>

<p>In 1847, Marx and Engels issued the Communist
Manifesto.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-4" href="#Footnote_XIV-4" class="fnanchor">XIV-4</a> This radical document was circulated
widely and became extensively accepted by social
revolutionists. Its doctrines were:</p>

<p>1. Abolition of property in lands; rents to be
used for public purposes.</p>

<p>2. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.</p>

<p>3. Progressive income tax.</p>

<p>4. Nationalization of the means of transportation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
and commerce.</p>

<p>5. Extension of productive enterprises by the
state.</p>

<p>6. Compulsory labor.</p>

<p>7. Free education; no child labor.</p>

<p>8. Elimination of the distrust between town
and country.</p>

<p>Marx returned to Germany and established the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> in Cologne in 1848. Engels
served as editor. Because of revolutionary
activity, Marx was forced to leave Germany in
1849. He went to Paris and then to London, where
he became a newspaper correspondent and where
he lived until his death in 1883.</p>

<p>In 1859, the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</i>
was published. It contains the essential principles
of Marx’s system of thought. In 1864, Marx
found the opportunity for which he had long been
seeking, namely, to organize the workers of the
world into one large association. On September
28, in St. Martin’s Hall, Marx in the presence of a
vast concourse of people, he initiated the “International
Workingmen’s Association.” The fundamental
idea was to organize the societies of workingmen
which have a common purpose, namely, the
emancipation of the working classes, into a world
or international union for co-operative purposes.
The International proposes that governments shall
put the interests of the working classes to the forefront
of national concern, and subordinate the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
attention they give to war, diplomacy, and national
jealousies.</p>

<p>In 1869, Marx, aided by Karl Liebknecht (1826–1900),
Engels and others, organized in Germany
the Social Democratic Labor Party. The movement
which Lassalle had started became united with
the Marxian movement, and in 1875 the German
Social Democracy presented a united front to capitalism.
Marx, Engels, Liebknecht, and Bebel are
its best-known leaders. Bismarck was forced to
acknowledge its power, and condescended to inaugurate
a system of social insurance in order to appease
its rank and file.</p>

<p>In 1867, 1885, and 1895, the three volumes of
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Das Kapital</i> appeared, in chronological order.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-5" href="#Footnote_XIV-5" class="fnanchor">XIV-5</a> By
this work, <i>Capital</i>, Marx is known throughout the
world. The style is laborious; the analyses are
minute and in places difficult to follow. The method
is historical. Marx analyzes social evolution. He
traces the rise of capitalism from its humble beginnings
to its autocratic fruition. In this development
the instruments of capital showed a tendency
to congregate in a decreasing number of
hands. By this token it will be seen that the number
of the propertyless ever increases. Likewise,
their influence decreases. In this way, the proletariat
is developed, a product of capitalism.</p>

<p>A definite class, the capitalist, acquires increasing
industrial, political, and social power. The proletariat
suffer increasing misery. They own nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
except their ability to labor. They are forced to
throw this human quality on the commercial market
and sell it to the highest bidder. But capitalism
increases the number of the proletariat. This
tendency, together with the increase in population,
creates a superabundance of labor. Laborers are
forced to compete in the labor market. The laborers
who will sell their labor for the least wages will
be employed. Capitalism thus forces wages to a
mere subsistence level, with the result that the misery
and suffering of the proletariat are greatly augmented.
In this way the laborer is crushed by the
operation of the iron law of wages.</p>

<p>By the operation of the iron law, the capitalist
is enabled to appropriate to himself an increasing
amount of the earnings of labor. This appropriated
amount is called the surplus value. Marx
developed at length the concept of surplus value.
Capitalism exploits the laborer by taking possession
of as large a proportion of the earnings of labor
as it can obtain—through its might and its shrewdness.</p>

<p>The growth of capitalism, also, causes a class
consciousness to develop among the members of the
proletariat. This class consciousness is increasing.
It produces labor organizations; these organizations
are acquiring vast power. The struggles between
them and the capitalistic classes go on. The
two groups have little in common. By force of
numbers the proletariat are bound finally to win,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
and to overthrow the capitalistic classes which are
now in power. They will seize the means of production
and manage them for the good of all.</p>

<p>Marx did not outline an utopia. He described the
historical evolution of society as he saw it, and he
participated in plans for the organization of all
laborers for their common good. Inasmuch as
Marx advocated compulsory labor, the laboring
class under Marxian socialism would include all
people. Marx advocated an equal distribution of
wealth, not in the sense of the popular misconception
of that term, but in the sense that the earnings
from the industry shall be distributed to the workers
in proportion to their achievements.</p>

<p>In Russia, Marxian socialism in 1918 came into
power. The Bolsheviki represent the radical wing
of the Marxian followers. They established essentially
a dictatorship of the proletariat, substituting
it for the dictatorship of capitalists which existed
under the reign of the czars. Bolshevism substitutes
occupation for geographic area as a basis of
representative government. This program is deficient
and sociologically untenable, because occupational
groups do not encompass all phases of human
personality. A government based on occupational
group needs is representative of only a portion of
the elements of human life. When seventy-five
per cent of the people are illiterate, as has been the
case in Russia, no form of government whether
democratic or not can be other than a dictatorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>Revolutionary socialism coincides, in part, with
syndicalism, a movement which developed in France
and England. Syndicalism is a radical form of
trade unionism. It declares that workingmen cannot
hope for genuine betterment through politics.
They must organize and inaugurate a general
strike. This universal strike will paralyze the present
régime and render it helpless. As a result the
workers will come into power. In the meantime,
the workers must keep up a running warfare with
capitalists and the government which supports capitalism.
Sabotage is a common concept among
syndicalists. It implies a program of destroying
machinery, hindering the production of economic
goods, and creating inefficiency in capitalistic industry.
In both England and the United States,
syndicalism has appeared. In the United States,
the Industrial Workers of the World, or I. W. W.,
confess to doctrines similar to those which have
been espoused in Europe under the name of syndicalism.
The philosophic exponent of syndicalism
has been George Sorel.</p>

<p>Revolutionary socialism has been paralleled in
certain ways by anarchism. These teachings first
acquired force through the writings of Proudhon.
Another leading anarchist was the Russian nobleman
and military officer, Michael Bakunin (1814–1876).
Although of aristocratic birth, Bakunin
became furious when he observed the human misery
among the masses which Russian autocracy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
producing. He became an agitator. He was confined
in dungeons and exiled to Siberia. He escaped
from Siberia, and by way of California went
to England and then to Switzerland. His chief
work is <i>God and the State</i>. Vital, vigorous, magnetic,
fearless—these are the adjectives which describe
the personality of Bakunin.</p>

<p>Bakunin scorned rank, birth, and fortune. He
attacked external authority of all kinds. He denied
the validity of concepts such as “God” and the
“state”; they are parts of systems which enslave
the free will of man. Classes must be abolished
and the masses of individuals freed from all enslaving
institutions, such as marriage, the church,
the state.</p>

<p>In a related way Prince Kropotkin (1842–1921)
developed anarchistic principles. Peter A. Kropotkin
was of aristocratic Russian birth and a person
of mild, courteous manners. His father was a
serf owner; the son could not bear to see the sufferings
which the serfs underwent. He threw away
the privileges of rank and became a defender of
the oppressed. He attempted to correlate the theories
of anarchism with those of mutual aid, and
fought socialism with the concept of centralized
control on the ground that it would destroy individual
liberty.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-6" href="#Footnote_XIV-6" class="fnanchor">XIV-6</a> In <a href="#Chapter_XXII">Chapter XXII</a>, Kropotkin’s
theory of mutual aid will be analyzed.</p>

<p>Anarchism and socialism make similar attacks
upon the evils of capitalism. Both are determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
to overthrow capitalism. Both believe in revolt.
They part ways when they advocate a constructive
program for the new order which shall follow the
violent overthrow of capitalism. Unlike socialism,
anarchism holds that all government is an evil and
that industry can go on without organization. It
advocates a free communism.</p>

<p>One of the essentials in the Communist Manifesto
was the appropriation of rents for public purposes.
Starting from a viewpoint distinctly different
from that of Karl Marx, Henry George (1839–1897)
became the founder of single tax propaganda.
In early manhood Henry George came to
San Francisco and established a struggling newspaper.
At once he found himself practically overwhelmed
by the brutal competition of the metropolitan
press and telegraphic news service. George
was crushed by monopoly. It was this defeat which
gave him a new idea—an idea that was to command
the attention of the world.</p>

<p>As George walked the streets of New York City
he puzzled over the existence of indescribable destitution
and suffering in the shadow of the princely
rich with their ostentatious luxuries.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-7" href="#Footnote_XIV-7" class="fnanchor">XIV-7</a> Why in a
land blessed with generous natural resources should
there be such poverty? Although discovery has
followed discovery and invention has followed invention,
neither has lessened the toil of those who
most need respite. With material progress poverty
takes on a larger aspect. Material progress may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
be likened to an immense wedge which is being
forced, not underneath society, but through society.
“Those who are above the point of separation are
elevated, but those who are below are crushed
down.”<a id="FNanchor_XIV-8" href="#Footnote_XIV-8" class="fnanchor">XIV-8</a> George set himself the task of finding out
why poverty is associated with progress.</p>

<p>This cause George found in the land situation.
As land increases in value, poverty increases. The
price of land is an index of the disparity in the economic
conditions of the people at the extremes of
the social scale. Land is more valuable in New
York City than in San Francisco, and there is more
squalor and misery in New York City than in San
Francisco. Land is more valuable in London than
in New York City, and likewise there is more
squalor and destitution in London than in New
York City.</p>

<p>When increasing numbers of people live in a limited
area under a system of private property in land,
rents are raised and land values go up. The cost
of living mounts, wages are kept to a minimum,
overcongestion of population ensues; and again,
rents and land values are increased.</p>

<p>Upon what does title to land rest? Where did
it originate? In force. But has the first comer
at a banquet the right to turn back all the chairs,
and claim that none of the other guests shall partake
of the food that has been provided? Does the
first passenger who enters a railroad car thereby
possess the right to keep out all other persons, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
admit them only upon payment to him of sums of
money? “We arrive and we depart, guests at a
banquet continually spread, spectators and participants
in an entertainment where there is room for
all who come.”<a id="FNanchor_XIV-10" href="#Footnote_XIV-10" class="fnanchor">XIV-10</a> These illustrations are pertinent
to the unjust elements in the present economic
order.</p>

<p>As a result of private property in land, the owner
possesses power over the tenant, a power which is
tantamount to a system of slavery. There is nothing
strange, therefore, in the poverty phenomena
of the world. The Creator has not placed in the
world the taint of injustice. The fact that amid our
highest civilization men faint and die with want, is
not because of the niggardliness of nature or the
injustice of the Creator, but is due to the injustice
of man.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-11" href="#Footnote_XIV-11" class="fnanchor">XIV-11</a> Since the owner of land receives wealth
without labor to an increasing degree, so there is
an increasing robbery of earnings of those who
labor.</p>

<p>George attacked Malthusianism, and pointed out
the deficiencies in the proposed remedies for poverty,
such as greater economy in government, diffusion
of knowledge, and improved habits of industry.
He then proceeded to give his own and well
known solution, namely, making land common property
through a system of taxation of land values
alone. Since land, not labor, is the source of all
wealth, it is just and necessary to make land common
property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>The weakness of Henry George’s argument lies
in his single panacea for securing justice. He over-emphasized
the importance of one line of procedure.
He neglects other important factors, such as a
selfish human nature. He rendered, however, a
splendid service in showing the weaknesses in the
system of private property in land. In this connection
he has been unequaled in his contribution
to social thought.</p>

<p>In this discussion of the contributions of socialism
to social thought, many types or expressions of
socialism have not been presented. The educational
propaganda of the Fabian socialists in England
should be mentioned as being very effective. Although
small in number this group of intellectuals,
the best known being Sidney and Beatrice Webb,
have exerted a constructive and practical influence
upon social thought.</p>

<p>Socialism has assumed various phases. (1)
It originated in utopianism and in a loose, broad
type of communism. (2) It then took the form
of associationism, urging the organization of
groups of associated individuals, such as phalanges.
As utopianism was in part the expression of a poetic
imagination, so associationism represented a bourgeois
philosophy. (3) In the next place socialism
assumed political aspirations, and advocated a governmental
program whereby the existing governments
shall gradually extend their power until they
exercise control over rent-producing land and interest-producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
capital. (4) State socialism, however,
was supplanted in many minds by ideas of
more radical procedure. Marxian socialism holds
that a class conflict is inevitable and that the
workers must overthrow the capitalists, together
with the governments which they control. (5) To
the other radical extreme is philosophic anarchism,
with its emphasis upon the abolition of all existing
governments and the establishment of individual
autonomy.</p>

<p>Socialism has made several contributions to
social thought. (1) It has called the attention of
civilized mankind, and particularly of the economically
wealthy classes, to the needs of the weaker
classes. It has introduced humanitarian concepts
into the minds of the socially unthinking educated
classes. (2) It has jolted many economic autocrats
from their thrones of power. It has thrown
the spot light of publicity upon the selfish and
wicked ostentation of the hereditary leisure
classes. (3) It has held social theory to a more
practical course and to developing more immediate
social solutions than it otherwise would have
achieved. (4) It has developed a power equal to
that held by individualism. It has helped to demonstrate
the dualistic nature of social evolution, that
is, that there are two poles to human life rather
than one.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Buckle and Geographic Social Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>It has long been observed that climate, fertility
of soil, rainfall, and similar factors have had a powerful
influence upon human nature and upon the
development of civilization. The chief founders of
this line of thought were Buckle and Ratzel. In
recent years Semple and Huntington have become
well-known authorities. Many other thinkers have
contributed to the present knowledge concerning
the interactions between geographic factors and
human development.</p>

<p>One of the first writers to elaborate a climatic
theory of social evolution was Bodin (1530–1596).
Hot climates, he observed, further the rise of all
kinds of superstitious beliefs. Cold climates produce
brute will-power. Temperate climates constitute
an essential basis for the development of reason.
In the ideal commonwealth which Bodin described,
all three types of climate are represented.<a id="FNanchor_XV-1" href="#Footnote_XV-1" class="fnanchor">XV-1</a>
The northern zone furnishes the fighters and the
workers. The southern zone produces poets,
priests, and artists. The temperate zone is the parent
of legislative, judicial, and scholarly leaders.</p>

<p>In the <i>Spirit of Laws</i> to which reference was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
made in <a href="#Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a>, Montesquieu accentuated the
importance of environmental influences on social
processes. He attempted to show the effects of climate
upon social institutions. Montesquieu did important
pioneer work in what is now known as the
field of anthropo-geography.</p>

<p>By way of contrast, the attitude of Hume, whose
contributions to social psychology have already
been noted, stands out sharply. According to
Hume, physical causes have no particular effect on
the human mind. No geographic factors influence
either the temperament, disposition, or ability of
people. Hume was led to this extreme position by
his staunch faith in the subjective and psychological
factors of human nature.</p>

<p>The distinguished German scientist, Alexander
von Humboldt (1769–1859), travelled extensively
throughout the world, observing the physical geography
of many lands in conjunction with the meteorological
conditions of each. At the same time
von Humboldt was a careful observer of the customs,
manners, and standards of the various peoples
with whom he came in contact. In these
travels and studies, von Humboldt was careful to
note relationships between soils and civilizations.
His contributions to social thought were of this
descriptive nature, based on first-hand observations
in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>The writings of Henry Thomas Buckle (1821–1862)
contain an extensive and detailed explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
of the ways in which geographic and natural factors
modify human life. Buckle starts with a decidedly
dualistic universe—a dualism which is disjunctive.
The dualism consists of nature and mind, each subject
more or less to its own laws. Rejecting both
the doctrine of free will and of predestination,
Buckle concludes that the actions of men are determined
solely by their antecedents and that they have
a character of uniformity.<a id="FNanchor_XV-2" href="#Footnote_XV-2" class="fnanchor">XV-2</a> Man modifies nature,
and nature modifies man, but in the past in many
parts of the world the thoughts and desires of men
are more influenced by physical phenomena than
they influence such phenomena. Because of this
dominant activity of the physical forces, these
should be studied as a basis for understanding the
history of man.</p>

<p>The physical factors which have powerfully influenced
men are four: climate, food, soil, and the
general aspects of nature. By the fourth, Buckle
refers to those appearances which are presented
chiefly through the medium of sight and which produce
their chief results by exciting the imagination
and suggesting superstitions. The three first-mentioned
factors do not operate on the mind directly.<a id="FNanchor_XV-3" href="#Footnote_XV-3" class="fnanchor">XV-3</a></p>

<p>The first effect of climate, food, and soil upon
man that may be noted is that they lead man to accumulate
wealth. These accumulations permit that
degree of leisure from “making a living” which enables
some members of society to acquire knowledge.
Upon these acquisitions of knowledge, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
of socialized knowledge, civilization depends.
This progress in the early stages of civilization
rests on two circumstances: “First, on the
energy and regularity with which labor is conducted,
and second, on the returns made to that
labor by the bounty of nature.”<a id="FNanchor_XV-4" href="#Footnote_XV-4" class="fnanchor">XV-4</a> Both these causes
are the results of physical antecedents. The returns
which are made to labor are regulated by the fertility
of the soil. Moreover, Buckle asserted, the
energy and regularity with which labor is conducted
will be entirely dependent on the influence of climate.<a id="FNanchor_XV-5" href="#Footnote_XV-5" class="fnanchor">XV-5</a>
When heat is intense, men will be indisposed
and partly unfitted for active industry. Climate
also affects the regularity of the habits of
laborers. In very cold climates, the weather interferes
with regular habits and produces desultoriness.
In southern countries regular labor is likewise
prevented—this time by the heat. Thus, in
the early stages of civilization the fundamental law
may be stated: the soil regulates the returns made
to any given amount of labor; the climate regulates
the energy and constancy of labor itself.<a id="FNanchor_XV-6" href="#Footnote_XV-6" class="fnanchor">XV-6</a></p>

<p>Of the two primary causes of primitive societary
growth, the fertility of the soil is more important
than the climatic influences. It is only where soil
fertility exists that civilization can arise at all.<a id="FNanchor_XV-7" href="#Footnote_XV-7" class="fnanchor">XV-7</a>
But in Europe, climate has been more effective than
soil fertility. In Europe a climate has existed which
has stimulated human activities.</p>

<p>Since the mental powers of man are unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
they are more important, once they get started, than
the powers of nature, which are limited and stationary.
Man has endless capacity, through his dynamic
mental tendencies to develop the physical resources
of the earth.</p>

<p>The birth rate depends on food supply. In hot
countries, where less food per capita is required
than in cold countries, and where an abundance of
food exists, the birth rate is very high. In cold
countries highly carbonized food is necessary, but
this food is largely animal in origin and great risk
is involved in procuring it. Hence the people of
cold countries become adventuresome.<a id="FNanchor_XV-8" href="#Footnote_XV-8" class="fnanchor">XV-8</a></p>

<p>By the study of physical laws it is possible to determine
what the national food of a country will
be. In India, for example, the physical conditions
are decidedly favorable to the growth of rice, which
is the most nutritive of all cereals, and which, consequently,
is a causal factor in a high birth rate.</p>

<p>But where there is a cheap national food, the increase
in population becomes very great. As a result,
there are multitudes of people who are able
to keep just above the subsistence level. A few
individuals who understand the operation of these
physical laws are able to manipulate the multitudes
in such a way as to make themselves immensely
wealthy. Since wealth, after intellect, is the most
permanent source of power, a great inequality of
wealth has been accompanied by a corresponding
inequality of social and political power.<a id="FNanchor_XV-9" href="#Footnote_XV-9" class="fnanchor">XV-9</a> It produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
classes and even castes. Poverty provokes
contempt. Class conflict results. The poor are
ground low, murmur, and are again subjected to
ignominy. Under such conditions democracy has
a hard struggle. When physical conditions favor
one class, that class will constitute itself the government
and bitterly oppose the extension of government
to all other classes. In Europe there was no
cheap national food, no blind multiplication of
population, and hence no such disparity between
classes as in India. In Europe it has been easier
for democratic movements to spread.</p>

<p>Early civilization developed in the Euphrates
valley, the Nile valley, and in the exceedingly fertile
regions of Peru, Central America, and Mexico.
Modern civilization is found largely in fertile river
valleys, such as the Thames, Seine, Rhine, Po, Danube,
Hudson, Mississippi. But in the Amazon valley,
the fertility of soil has not invited the growth
of a large population. The trade winds have
brought in a superabundance of moisture, producing
torrential rains, and a luxuriance of plant life
and a complexity of virile animal life which thus far
have defied the skill of man to overcome.</p>

<p>The fourth physical factor which Buckle presents
is the general aspects of nature. Of these the first
class excites the imagination and the second stimulates
the rational operations of the intellect.<a id="FNanchor_XV-10" href="#Footnote_XV-10" class="fnanchor">XV-10</a> In
regard to natural phenomena it may be said that
whatever inspires feelings of terror, of the vague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
and uncontrollable, and of great wonder tends to
inflame the imagination and to cause it to dominate
the intellectual processes. Where nature is continually
exhibiting its power, man feels his inferiority.
He assumes a helpless attitude. He ceases to inquire
or to think. His imagination, rather than his
reason, reigns. On the other hand, where nature
works smoothly and quietly, man begins to assert
his individuality. He even essays to dominate nature
and other men. His cognition develops and
his volition expresses itself vigorously.</p>

<p>All early civilizations were located in the tropics
or sub-tropics. In these regions nature is dangerous
to man. Earthquakes, tempests, hurricanes,
pestilences prevail. Consequently, the imagination
of man takes exaggerated forms. The judgment is
overbalanced; thought is paralyzed. The mind is
continually thrown into a frantic state. These reactions
throw human life into feeling molds, into
poetic rather than scientific forms. Religious feelings
are promoted. The leading religions of the
world originated in the sub-tropical and tropical
regions of the earth.</p>

<p>East Indian literature and thought illustrate the
effect of nature upon the feelings and the imagination.
The works of the East Indians on grammar,
law, history, medicine, even on mathematics, geography,
and metaphysics are nearly all poems.<a id="FNanchor_XV-11" href="#Footnote_XV-11" class="fnanchor">XV-11</a>
Prose writing is despised. The Sanscrit language
boasts of more numerous and more complicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
metres than can any European tongue. The East
Indian literature is even calculated to set the reason
of man at defiance.<a id="FNanchor_XV-12" href="#Footnote_XV-12" class="fnanchor">XV-12</a></p>

<p>The imagination, for example, in India has produced
an exaggerated respect for the past; it is
this situation which has led poets to describe a
Golden Age in the remote past. In the literature
of India there is recorded the statement that in
ancient times the average length of life of common
men was 80,000 years. There are instances of poets
who lived to be half a million years old.</p>

<p>In Greece, on the other hand, nature is more
quiet and the mind of man functioned in a reasoning
way. In the North Temperate zone science
developed. “The climate was more healthy; earthquakes
were less frequent; hurricanes were less
disastrous; wild beasts and noxious animals less
abundant.”<a id="FNanchor_XV-13" href="#Footnote_XV-13" class="fnanchor">XV-13</a> Buckle, in other words, insists that
everywhere the hand of nature is upon the mind of
man.</p>

<p>The work of Buckle, the chief exponent of the
influence of physical nature upon mental man, accentuates
important phases of the growth of civilization.
Buckle over-emphasized his anthropo-geographic
observations. However, they constitute a
part of the whole picture of human progress, and
when seen in the light of modern mental growth
and control of environment they shrink into proper
proportions.</p>

<p>The field which Buckle opened has been developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
extensively by Friedrich Ratzel (1844–1904).
This German scholar, traveler, and geographer is
generally credited with putting anthropo-geography
on a scientific basis. Miss Ellen Semple attempted
to translate his work on <i>Anthropo-Geographie</i> into
English, but found the German constructions so
difficult to handle accurately that it was necessary
for her to put Ratzel’s observations into her own
words. She also points out in Buckle a lack of
system and an undue tendency to follow one generalization
after another. Her own <i>Influences of
Geographic Environment</i> has now become a standard
work on the ways in which physical nature
affects mankind.</p>

<p>Miss Semple, following but improving upon Ratzel,
has shown in turn the influences of geographical
location, area, and boundaries upon people. She
indicates the various ways in which oceans, rivers,
and coast lines have molded human minds; she distinguishes
between mountain, steppe, and desert
effects upon mankind. She describes man as a
product of the earth’s surface. She stresses unduly
the physical influences; she considers nature the
dominating force. Even where civilized man has
developed inventive powers and spiritual prowess,
nature is given the credit.<a id="FNanchor_XV-14" href="#Footnote_XV-14" class="fnanchor">XV-14</a> Nevertheless, Miss
Semple has marshalled facts in powerful array and
increased their force by literary skill. No student
or teacher can afford to neglect Miss Semple’s extensive
survey of the interactions between physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
nature and human progress.</p>

<p>Among the many other writers upon the relation
of geographic factors to civilization the investigations
of Ellsworth Huntington are significant.<a id="FNanchor_XV-15" href="#Footnote_XV-15" class="fnanchor">XV-15</a>
He has described the climatic conditions that are
most favorable to mental stimulation and growth,
and then has classified all districts of the earth according
to the degree in which they stimulate or
arrest mental advance.</p>

<p>In this same connection William Z. Ripley has
investigated the relation of climate to races.<a id="FNanchor_XV-16" href="#Footnote_XV-16" class="fnanchor">XV-16</a> After
analyzing races and distinguishing between them
and the geographic influences upon pigmentation,
head, form, stature, and other traits, mainly structural,
he classifies climatic elements in order of importance,
as follows: humidity, heat, and monotony.
A high humidity, excessive heat, and long series of
sunshine or of cloudy weather produce mental enervation,
stagnation, and retrogression.</p>

<p>Acclimatization of races is a very slow process,
according to Ripley. It requires centuries. Perhaps
the white race can never become truly acclimated
in the tropics. Racial differences he shows
are due to environmental factors far more than is
ordinarily supposed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said that physical forces
have operated strongly on man. But when man
has developed modern mental tools, he has been
able to escape a part of the enslaving environmental
influences. The history of the relation of geographic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
factors to human progress indicates a
fundamental but a proportionate decrease in those
influences.</p>

</div>

<p>In the second half of the last century social
thought passed under biological influence. Society
was discussed in terms of biological analogies, that
is, it was compared in its structure and functions
to organic life. Herbert Spencer was the leader
among those writers who attempted to analyze society
in terms of biological figures of speech. He
also stressed the structural nature of society, and
in his <i>Principles of Sociology</i> he went into great
detail in giving a historical description of social
institutions.</p>

<p>The Greek writers, the Hebrews before them,
the founder of Christianity made references to the
likenesses between human society and plant and
animal life. Mankind has often been compared
to a tree or a plant with its manifold, evolving
branches and fruit.</p>

<p>Spencer’s famous organic analogies were preceded
by the studies of biologists, such as Lamarck
and Darwin. Lamarck (1744–1829) argued that
by activity and use man could develop traits which
would be transmitted by inheritance. Although
this theory has been undermined by Weismann, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
served as a basis for the further study of the biological
laws of human evolution.</p>

<p>The thought of Charles Darwin (1809–1882)
upon the nature of evolution was stimulated in part
by Malthus’ doctrine of surplus population and the
consequent struggle for existence. He also based
his ideas on the Lamarckian theory of transmission
of acquired characters. He developed the concepts
of the prodigality of nature and the struggle for
existence, which led to the resultant concept of
natural selection and survival of the fittest. The
process of natural selection accounts for the instincts,
imitation, imagination, reason as well as
for self-consciousness, and the esthetic and religious
impulses. In this way man, according to the Darwinian
formula, has ascended by stages from the
lower orders of life.</p>

<p>The fittest to survive, concluded Darwin, are
those individuals who are best fitted to meet the
conditions of their environment. If the environment
be competitive, savage, brutal, then the fittest
will be the strongest physically and the most vicious.
If the environment be co-operative, then the fittest
will be the individuals who co-operate best. With
the development of intelligence and sagacity in
early human society, individuals otherwise cruel
learned to co-operate. A tribe of co-operating individuals
would be victorious in a conflict with a
tribe of non-co-operating members. Thus co-operation
and a co-operating environment themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
are the result of natural selection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Darwin’s concept of natural selection
has been grossly distorted. Upon this misapprehension,
a doctrine of “social Darwinism”
has gained recognition. According to this false
interpretation of Darwinism, the tooth and fang
struggle for existence among animals is the normal
procedure among human beings. The most brutal,
cruel, and shrewd men are “fitted” to survive in
an environment of physical and mental competition.
Likewise, the nations which can marshal together
the most powerful armies and navies are the
“fittest” to survive in a world where each nation
is accountable unto itself alone. Thus, it is seen
that human society is simply an extension of the
animal society and that the fundamental law of
social progress is the law of force and might, first
physical, and then physical and psychical.</p>

<p>But this interpretation is false to Darwin’s own
principles. While Darwin did describe and lay
great emphasis upon the tooth and fang struggle
for existence, he noted and stressed the fact that
even among animals, modifying influences were at
work. He made clear that co-operation exists
among many species of animal life, and that this co-operative
tendency is an important survival factor.
He also saw that among the highest types of animals
there were new and complex expressions of
co-operation, and that the higher mental activity
of these animal types seemed to be a correlate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
some way of the greater co-operative spirit. The
application of this principle to human progress implies
that the co-operative spirit may ultimately
become the chief survival force, and that some day
the “fittest” to survive will be those individuals or
groups of individuals who co-operate most wisely.
This theory will be developed further in the chapter
upon “Co-operation Theories in Sociology.”
The chief contributors have been Kropotkin and
Novicow.</p>

<p>Darwin made another important contribution to
social science in his theory of sexual selection.
This idea is a phase of natural selection. Among
the higher animals the females choose their mates.
The males, for example, with the singing voice and
beautiful plumage, are the most likely to be chosen.
These males thus become the progenitors of the
next generation of the given species; the less attractive
males mate if at all with the inferior types
of females. Thus signs of male attractiveness
come to possess survival value.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-1" href="#Footnote_XVI-1" class="fnanchor">XVI-1</a></p>

<p>Among human beings the principle of sexual
selection operates, but in a reversed sexual form.
During the earlier centuries of human history the
custom developed whereby the males took the initiative
in choosing mates. As a result, the females
resorted to all sorts of devices to make themselves
“attractive” and to get themselves “selected.”</p>

<p>The social theories of Herbert Spencer (1820–1903)
have caused more controversy than those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
any other writer in the sociological field. The fact
that in these controversies the ideas of Spencer
have usually been worsted will not blind the fair-minded
seeker after truth to the important rôle
which Spencer took in the field of social thought.</p>

<p>Spencer early developed the habit of causal thinking,
that is, he believed in causes, and hence
searched everywhere for causes. Because of the
acrimonious discussions which took place between
his father and mother, and because of his own independent
nature, he repudiated the orthodox religious
explanations of the universe. He was
trained for the profession of civil engineering. His
studies in mathematics and mechanics accentuated
his precise and somewhat materialistic interpretation
of the universe. His social theories are an outgrowth
in part of his emphasis upon the laws of
co-existence and sequences in the physical world.</p>

<p>In order to understand Spencer’s social laws it is
necessary first to consider his general law of evolution.
He traced everything in the world back
through causal chains to two fundamental factors,
namely, matter and motion—two aspects of force.
As a result of the operation of some First Cause,
an integration of matter began to take place, accompanied
by a concomitant dissipation of motion.
As a result, matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent
homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity.
During this process the unexpended motion
undergoes a similar change.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-2" href="#Footnote_XVI-2" class="fnanchor">XVI-2</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>The best explanation of this law of evolution can
be found in its application to societary phenomena.
Suppose that a modern city neighborhood undertakes
to organize itself. It possesses physical resources
and mental abilities. The “neighbors” are
all more or less untrained in community organization
activities. In this sense they are homogeneous.
At first they are unable to work together; in fact
they do not know what to do; thus, they form “an
indefinite, incoherent homogeneity.” But with experience
in community organization activities, the
individuals of the neighborhood learn to work together.
Each finds the type of work which he can
do best. All work toward a definite goal. Thus, a
definite, coherent heterogeneity arises. Further,
the unexpended energies of the people are influenced
and transformed by the pattern ideas which
experience in community organization measures
has taught.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-3" href="#Footnote_XVI-3" class="fnanchor">XVI-3</a></p>

<p>This application of Spencer’s law of evolution to
human progress has weak as well as strong points.
There is not always an original homogeneity. Upon
close examination this homogeneity disappears before
a variegated conglomeration of heterogeneous
experiences and potentialities of all the individuals
who are concerned. It is not necessary to point out
additional errors. Spencer deserves credit, however,
for developing the concept of social evolution
as a phase of natural evolution and for stressing the
idea of natural causation in societary matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>Spencer began his <i>Principles of Sociology</i> with a
very elaborate description of primitive man—the
original societary unit corresponding to the biological
cell. The physical, emotional, and intellectual
life of primitive man is given prominence. An
analysis is made of the behavior of man, the
original social unit, when he is exposed to the
various environing conditions—inorganic, organic,
and super-organic. The emphasis upon “man” as
the primary unit neglects the importance of the
“group” in the social evolutionary process. Moreover,
Spencer underrated the intellectual nature of
primitive man; he denied to early man the qualities
involving excursiveness of thought, imagination,
and original ideas.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-4" href="#Footnote_XVI-4" class="fnanchor">XVI-4</a></p>

<p>Spencer’s discussion of primitive ideas shows
widespread reading of volumes of source materials.
The “inductions” are often influenced by preconceived
notions of human life, despite Spencer’s sincere
desire and effort to be scientific. While the
horde, the family, and other groups are described,
the influences which are the result of the interaction
of individual minds and the interactions between
the individual and his group are scarcely
recognized.</p>

<p>In regard to the state, Spencer carried forward
the theories which have already been noted, namely,
of individual rights. He repudiated the state which
is the product of the military organization of
society. Such a régime is primordial and uncivilized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
It is an organization of homogeneous
units in which the units, or the individuals, are
slaves to the organization.</p>

<p>Spencer believed in a new industrial development
whereby individuals would become differentiated
and developed, and whereby individuals would
be shifted from an autocratic maximum to a
democratic maximum. To Spencer, man is vastly
superior to the state. In the coming industrial
order Spencer foresaw an era in which the main
business of society will be to defend the rights of
individuals. Spencer forecasted an epoch of industrial
states which have abolished war. In such a
day the only conflicts that will take place between
states will be natural. These will be only the competitions
that arise naturally between states that
are engaged in building up the best individuals, that
is, those persons who develop their individuality
most freely and harmoniously.</p>

<p>The rise of industrial states with a minimum
emphasis upon government and a maximum emphasis
upon individuality will produce a world
order in which national barriers will slowly melt
away and a planetary unity will develop. Spencer’s
industrialism, however, has fundamental weaknesses.
It implies that social organization is more
important than social process. It neglects to provide
for inherent psychical changes. It assumes
that an industrial society, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, will be peaceful.
It underestimates the importance of socializing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
motives.</p>

<p>In the changes from a military to an industrial
organization of society, the six main sets of social
institutions undergo deep-seated changes. Spencer
describes at length these six institutional structures,
namely, the domestic, ceremonial, political,
ecclesiastical, professional, and industrial. Two,
the political and industrial, have been mentioned on
the preceding page. Spencer’s treatment of the
other four is accurate to a degree but at fundamental
points is unreliable—judged by current conceptions
and data.</p>

<p>Perhaps Spencer is best known for his treatment
of the organic analogy. He set up the hypothesis
that society is like a biological organism and then
proceeded to defend his thesis against all objections
with great logical force. But logic was his sociological
downfall, for it overcame his scientific insight.</p>

<p>Spencer found four main ways in which society
resembles an organism.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-5" href="#Footnote_XVI-5" class="fnanchor">XVI-5</a> (1) In both cases growth
is attended by augmentation of mass. (2) In each
instance growth is accomplished by increasing complexity
of structure. (3) In the organism and
in society there is an interdependence of parts.
(4) The life of society, like the life of an organism,
is far longer than the life of any of the units or
parts.</p>

<p>But there are ways in which society and an organism
are unlike.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-6" href="#Footnote_XVI-6" class="fnanchor">XVI-6</a> These were analyzed by Spencer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
and determined to be merely superficial differences.
There are four of these main differences.
(1) Unlike organisms, societies have no specific extensive
form, such as a physical body with limbs or
a face. (2) The elements of society do not form
a continuous whole as in the case of an animal.
The living units composing society are free, and not
in contact, being more or less dispersed. (3) The
parts of society are not stationary and fixed in their
positions relative to the whole. (4) In an organism
consciousness is concentrated in a small part of the
aggregate, while in society consciousness is diffused.
The alleged superficiality in this difference
between society and an organism was difficult for
Spencer to maintain.</p>

<p>In discussing the organic analogy further, Spencer
compared the alimentary system of an organism
to the productive industries, or the sustaining system
in the body politic.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-7" href="#Footnote_XVI-7" class="fnanchor">XVI-7</a> Furthermore, there is a
strong parallelism between the circulatory system
of an organism and the distributing system in
society with its transportation lines; but more particularly,
its commercial classes and media of exchange.
Then, in both cases there has developed
regulating systems. In an organism there is a dominant
center and subordinate centers, the senses,
and a neural apparatus. A similar structure appears
in society in the form of an adjustive apparatus,
or government, for the purpose of adjudicating
the differences between the producers and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
consumers. These parallelisms throw only a small
measure of light upon the nature of society. They
appear ridiculous when carried to an extreme, for
example, to the extreme to which Spencer himself
went when he compared the King’s Council to the
medulla oblongata, the House of Lords to the
cerebellum, and the House of Commons to the
cerebrum.</p>

<p>Spencer uses his analogies very extensively and
vigorously, and later refers to them as merely a
scaffolding for building a structure of deductions.
This conclusion contains contradictory elements.
When the scaffolding is removed, society is left
standing as a more or less intangible affair. If a
society is like an organism, it experiences a natural
cycle of birth, maturity, old age, and death. But
according to the telic concept of progress that was
advanced by Lester F. Ward and developed by later
writers, the death of society does not come with
organic inevitableness, but depends on the vision,
plans, courage, and activities of that society’s members.
A society need never die.</p>

<p>For many years it has been popular to criticise
Spencer. Nearly all the criticisms are justified.
Moreover, they have been so numerous that little of
worth seems to be left in Spencer’s writings. However,
Spencer’s contributions to social thought are
not negligible for several reasons. (1) He emphasized
the laws of evolution and natural causation.
(2) He described social evolution as a phase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
of natural evolution. (3) He pointed out the likenesses
between biological organisms and human
society. (4) He made the rôle of social structures,
or institutions, to stand out distinctly. (5) He
stressed the importance of individuality. (6) He
undermined the idea that the State is a master
machine to which all the individual citizens must
submit automatically.</p>

<p>In the United States, Spencer possessed an able
and loyal friend in John Fiske (1842–1901).
Fiske built his social thought upon the evolutionarily
formulae of Darwin and Spencer. In his
<i>Cosmic Philosophy</i>, or philosophy of the universe,
Fiske contended that the evolution of man produced
fundamental changes in the nature of cosmic evolution.
With the development of man there appears
a new force in the universe, the human spirit, or
soul. The advent of this psychical entity has produced
a subordination of the purely bodily, physical,
material forces and established a control by
spiritual forces. Moreover, in human evolution
there has been a slowly increasing subordination of
the selfish phases of spiritual life to the altruistic.
With the apparent cessation in important bodily
changes there have come unheralded and unanticipated
psychical inventions, which have released man
from the passive adaptation to environment which
animals manifest, and given to him an increasingly
positive control over the processes of adaptation.
Humanity as the highest product of the evolutionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
processes has the power to change the whole
course of cosmic development. Fiske distinctly
emphasized the psychical forces in evolution and
the part which they are playing in making mankind
purposeful and in organizing groups on social principles.
Humanity is not a mere incident in evolution;
it is the supreme factor.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-9" href="#Footnote_XVI-9" class="fnanchor">XVI-9</a> The main purpose
of man is not the perpetuation of the species, but
the development of increasingly higher and more
social purposes.</p>

<p>Following the ideas of Maine, Tylor, McLennan,
and Lubbock, Fiske concluded that social evolution
originated when families, “temporarily organized
among all the higher gregarious mammals, became
in the case of the highest mammal permanently
organized.”<a id="FNanchor_XVI-10" href="#Footnote_XVI-10" class="fnanchor">XVI-10</a> Gregariousness developed into definite
family relationships and responsibilities. Social
evolution produced an increased complexity and
specialty in intelligence, which in turn required a
lengthening of the period “during which the nervous
connections involved in ordinary adjustments
are becoming organized.” Such a transformation
requires time, and hence the need for a period of
infancy which is not common to the lower animals.
Accompanying this period of infancy, there is the
development of strong affection of relatively short
duration among higher animals. Among mankind
parental love takes on the characteristics not only
of intensity and unselfishness but of duration and
forgiveness. In this phase of evolution there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
correlative development of three factors, namely,
the prolongation of infancy, the rise of parental
affection, and increasing intelligence. The gradual
prolongation of the period of infancy is partly a
consequence of increasing intelligence, and in turn
the prolongation of infancy affords the circumstances
for the establishment of permanent relationships,
of reciprocal behavior, of sociality.</p>

<p>Fiske was one of the first social philosophers to
point out the significance of foresight as a phase
of evolutionary development. Perhaps the chief
way in which civilized man is distinguished from
the barbarian is in his ability “to adapt his conduct
to future events, whether contingent or certain to
occur.” Civilized man has the power to forego
present enjoyment in order to safeguard himself
against future disaster.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-12" href="#Footnote_XVI-12" class="fnanchor">XVI-12</a> This quality is the essence
of prudence and is due in large part to civilized
man’s superior power of self-restraint, one of
the chief elements in moral progress. It is equally
important as “an indispensable prerequisite to the
accumulation of wealth in any community.” It is
the basic factor in civilized man’s elaborate scientific
provisions and in his numerous far-reaching
philosophic and religious systems.</p>

<p>Paul von Lilienfeld (1829–1903) made the organic
analogy a definite part of his theory of society.
He compared the individual to the cells in
an organism; the governmental and industrial organizations,
to the neural system; and the cultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
products of society, to the intercellular parts of an
organism.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-13" href="#Footnote_XVI-13" class="fnanchor">XVI-13</a></p>

<p>Lilienfeld compared the stages of growth of the
individual to the stages of racial development,
namely, savage, barbarian, and civilized. This
analogy was made use of by Fiske. Although somewhat
true in a very general sense, this recapitulation
theory cannot be carried into minute details.</p>

<p>The concept of social capitalization was originated
by Lilienfeld. By it he meant the ability of
society to store up useful ideas and methods and
transmit them from generation to generation. In
this way each generation becomes the inheritor of
all the human experiences that have gone before.</p>

<p>Lilienfeld was one of the first sociological
writers to develop the definite concept of social
pathology.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-14" href="#Footnote_XVI-14" class="fnanchor">XVI-14</a> His treatment of this theme, however,
was exceedingly weak. He distinguished between
a normal and diseased organism and then, by analogy,
between a normal and diseased society. Social
pathology, according to Lilienfeld, deals with
three sets of diseases, namely, of industry, of justice,
and of politics. Lilienfeld carried the organic
analogy to a ridiculous and puerile extreme when
he compared the diseases of industry to insanity;
of justice, to delirium; of politics, to paralysis. He
also elaborated a system of social therapeutics to
correspond to the diseases.</p>

<p>In Albert Schaeffle (1831–1903), the organic analogy
found another disciple, but a more worthy one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
than either Spencer or Lilienfeld. In the thought of
Schaeffle, society is not primarily a large organism
but a gigantic mind. Schaeffle presented a functional
analogy rather than a biological analogy.
Whereas Spencer was especially interested in social
structures, Schaeffle set his attention upon social
functions.</p>

<p>In his functional analogies Schaeffle compared the
reason with the legislature in society; the will, with
the executive officers; and the esthetic judgment,
with the judiciary. Schaeffle’s psychology is inaccurate
and on the whole unscientific; his analogies add
little to an understanding of society. Nevertheless,
his thought on these subjects represents an advance
over the ideas of Spencer.</p>

<p>In the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bau und Leben des Socialen Körpers</i>,
Schaeffle undertook to develop a complete sociological
system. His teachings follow the principle that
“function leads structure and structure limits function.”
Activities produce developments in bodily
structure, and also cause the formation of new
social institutions. Bodily structures and social institutions
alike limit activities and usefulness.
These propositions are a reversal of the emphasis
which Spencer maintained. They are fundamentally
correct.</p>

<p>Although Schaeffle referred frequently to the
“social body,” he did not give the concept a specific
meaning. He introduced the term “social
process,” but did not analyze its nature. He repudiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
the idea that the individual is the social unit;
he considered the group to be the all-important
unit in society. Natural selection in social evolution
manifests itself in conflicts between the ideals
of different groups. René Worms, it may be added,
has assumed the existence of a social consciousness
apart from the consciousness of individuals, and
argued that the chief difference between biological
organisms and social organizations is one of degree.</p>

<p>Schaeffle considered that government justifies itself
in protecting the weaker members of society,
and in maintaining the highest welfare of all. He
pointed out the social responsibility which rests
upon the best educated and most fortunate members
of society. Schaeffle wisely emphasized the
development of purposeful activity on the part of
both the individual and society.</p>

<p>The ideas of John Stuart Mackenzie differ from
those of Spencer, Lilienfeld, and Schaeffle. Mackenzie
does not use the figure of an organic analogy;
he speaks in terms of homologies. According
to Mackenzie, society is not like an organism; it
is organic.</p>

<p>The organic nature of society is three-fold. (1)
There is an intrinsic relation between the parts of
society and the whole. The individual reflects the
culture of the group in which he has been trained.
(2) The development of a group is by virtue of
intrinsic processes. A group builds on ideas derived
from both the past and from other groups,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
but it does not genuinely grow unless it takes these
ideas and makes them over into a part of its own
nature. (3) Society develops towards ends which
are discoverable in society itself. By analysis of
the ideals and motive forces of a group, it is possible
to determine in what direction the group is
moving.</p>

<p>Mackenzie argues for the inner principle of
things and particularly of society. He believes,
however, that knowledge concerning this inner
principle and the essential unity of mankind cannot
be reduced to a science, but will constitute the
basis of a social philosophy. Social philosophy does
not supply facts, but seeks to interpret the significance
of the special aspects of human life with
reference to the social unity of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-15" href="#Footnote_XVI-15" class="fnanchor">XVI-15</a></p>

<p>The family and the state are the two forms of
association in which the most intimate bonds of
union are nurtured. Language, if it can be called
a social institution, is perhaps the most fundamental
institution of all, because it produces that community
of spirit whereby intimacy in social intercourse
can take place and whereby the realization of a
common good can be achieved.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-16" href="#Footnote_XVI-16" class="fnanchor">XVI-16</a></p>

<p>According to Mackenzie, there are three main
lines of social progress, and hence three main types
of social control to be encouraged.<a id="FNanchor_XVI-17" href="#Footnote_XVI-17" class="fnanchor">XVI-17</a> (1) The
control of natural forces by human agencies. (2)
The control of individuals by the communal spirit.
(3) Self control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>The road of social advance is beset with obstacles.
The chief are these: (1) The dominance
of vegetative needs. These economic factors are
so universal and insistent that they are likely at any
time to override all other human needs. (2) The
insistence of animal impulses, chiefly love and
strife. While love promotes unity, it generally
produced a limited unity. Moreover, one mode of
unity is apt to conflict with other types of unity,
and thus lead to intense strife. (3) The mastery
of mechanism. Life is easily crushed under the
weight of organization; thought, by scholastic
pedantry; industry, by economic systems; nationality,
by soulless bureaucracy. (4) Anarchism.
The remedy for over-organization is not anarchy,
for life and society are composed of numbers of
conflicting tendencies, which must be controlled by
the power of thought. But the exercise of merely
individual thought will not suffice. Individual
thought is likely to be egocentric, to evade the
problems of group life, or to solve them selfishly.
(5) Conservatism. An established and successful
civilization is in danger of relying too much on
its past. It often carries within itself the canker
of decay, and frequently lacks any clear vision of
higher development.</p>

<p>Mackenzie is committed to internationalism. It
is no longer fitting for anyone to think of his own
country as an exclusive object of devotion. “The
earth is our country, and all its inhabitants are our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
fellow-citizens; and it is only the recognition of
this that entitles us to look for any lasting security.”</p>

<p>Mackenzie advances beyond the organic analogists
when he describes the ways in which society
is organic. As a social philosopher he has contributed
important pattern-ideas. He has escaped
from the foibles of the organic analogy and at the
same time indicated the values that lie beneath that
concept.</p>

<p>This chapter deals with a significant period in
the history of social thought. The biology of the
time was very faulty and the sociological applications
of biological knowledge were consequently of
little merit. The early years of the present century
were characterized by noteworthy improvements
in biological thinking. The facts about the laws of
heredity and variation increased in number; a science
of heredity was established. The first decade
of the present century also marks the rise of the
science of eugenics. In a later chapter the contributions
of recent scientific biology, and particularly
of eugenics, to social thought will be presented.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Sociology of Lester F. Ward</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The name of Lester F. Ward (1841–1913) stands
forth between the old and new eras of social
thought. Ward belongs to both the old and new.
He adopted Comtean positivism and built in part
upon Spencer’s evolutionary principles, but opposed
Spencer’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> ideas and his evolutionary
determinism, especially in regard to education.
Perhaps his most notable work was the way
in which he shocked a Spencerian-tinged world of
social thought into a new method of thinking.</p>

<p>Ward became the ardent advocate of social
telesis. Man can modify, defeat, or hasten the
processes of nature. Ward brought the concept of
dynamic sociology to the attention of the world.
Although he was interested in social statics, his
primary concern was in the fact that man through
the use of his intelligence can transform not only
the natural world but the social world, and that he
can harness not only the natural forces to social
ends, but even the social forces to social purposes.
Hence it is that Ward holds rank today, despite his
monistic philosophy and his false psychological beliefs,
as one of the world’s leading sociologists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>Lester F. Ward was born in Joliet, Illinois. He
received a limited schooling, and early went to
work, first on a farm and then as a wheelwright.
He manifested an unusual liking for books and to
a great extent was self-educated. He entered the
employment of the United States Government,
where he remained for more than forty years, after
he was honorably discharged from service in the
Civil War. In the Government service he held the
positions of geologist and paleontologist. Despite
his strenuous and efficient work for the Government,
he found time to think through and write
out an elaborate sociological system of thought.</p>

<p>Ward’s published works in sociology began with
his <i>Dynamic Sociology</i> (1883) and ended with
the <i>Glimpses of the Cosmos</i> (1913) in several volumes,
which, with the exception of volume one,
have been published posthumously. The intermediate
books of importance in order were: <i>Pure
Sociology</i>, <i>Applied Sociology</i>, and <i>Psychic Factors
of Civilization</i>.</p>

<p>Ward was characterized by an impressive command
of his subject and “a terrific mental drive.”
In 1906, he began the unique experiment of teaching
sociology at the age of 65. As a professor of
sociology he served Brown University until his
death—for a period of seven years. He was supported
by the indefatigable assistance of his wife,
as shown by the many files which she kept of “Reviews
and Press Notices”, “Autograph Letters,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
and “Biography.”</p>

<p>Ward was led to produce the <i>Dynamic Sociology</i>
because of his observation that preceding 1875
there was an essential sterility in social science
thinking. Ward observed that the prevalent teachings
of Herbert Spencer were statical, and that the
ideas of Spencer’s American disciples were only
passively dynamic. Ward believed that before the
science of society could be truly established the
active dynamic factors must be described. A science
which fails to benefit mankind is lifeless. To
save sociology from the lifelessness which it was
manifesting, Ward wrote the <i>Dynamic Sociology</i>.
He contemplated social phenomena “as capable of
intelligent control by society itself in its own interest.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-1" href="#Footnote_XVII-1" class="fnanchor">XVII-1</a>
His main thesis in the <i>Dynamic Sociology</i>
is “the necessity for universal education as
the one clear, overshadowing, and immediate social
duty to which all others are subordinate.” He argued
for a truly progressive system of popular scientific
education.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-2" href="#Footnote_XVII-2" class="fnanchor">XVII-2</a> He declared that not one-hundredth
of the facts which original research has already
brought forth are today obtainable by a one-hundredth
of the members of society, and hence
not one truth in ten thousand is fully apprehended.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-3" href="#Footnote_XVII-3" class="fnanchor">XVII-3</a></p>

<p>The prevailing doctrine in social thought, that of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> as championed by Spencer, drew forth
Ward’s best intellectual efforts as a challenger.
Ward protested against the teaching that natural
forces are operating only as elements in the all-powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
evolutionary process. He pointed out
that man is distinguished from animals by the development
of his psychical nature, i. e., of his foresight
and reason. He demonstrated that by this
development man is able to master and regulate the
operation of the blind evolutionary forces. Hence,
the doctrine of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> is not only false but
pernicious. It defeats social progress. The truth
is, said Ward, society is able to improve itself, and
it should set itself scientifically at once to the
opportunity.</p>

<p>Passive, or negative, progress is represented by
the social forces operating in their natural freedom,
subject only to general evolutionary laws.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-4" href="#Footnote_XVII-4" class="fnanchor">XVII-4</a> Active,
or positive, progress is represented by the social
forces guided by conscious human purposes. Social
statics deals with the nature of social order;
social dynamics treats of the laws of social progress.
Social dynamics concerns itself with two
types of studies. One line analyzes and describes
what is going on in society under the influence of
natural laws—this is pure sociology. It is pure
diagnosis; it has nothing to do with what society
ought to be. It describes the phenomena and laws
of society as they are.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-5" href="#Footnote_XVII-5" class="fnanchor">XVII-5</a> The other procedure discusses
the application of human purpose to the natural
social forces—this is applied sociology. It
studies the art of applying the active, or positive,
forces to the natural evolution of society. This
method is distinctly a human process and “depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
wholly on the action of man himself.” Applied
sociology treats of social ends and purposes.</p>

<p>Pure sociology describes the spontaneous development
of society; applied sociology deals with the
artificial means of accelerating the spontaneous
processes in society.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-6" href="#Footnote_XVII-6" class="fnanchor">XVII-6</a> Pure sociology treats of
achievement; applied sociology, of improvement.
But applied sociology is not social reform; “it does
not itself apply sociological principles, it seeks only
to show how they may be applied.” It lays down
principles as guides to social action. The carrying
of these principles into social and political practice
is social reform.</p>

<p>The distinction is now clear between natural and
artificial progress.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-7" href="#Footnote_XVII-7" class="fnanchor">XVII-7</a> The former is a blind growth;
the latter, a purposeful manufacture. One is a
genetic process; the other, a teleological process.
One is characterized by increasing differentiation;
the other, by a process of calculation. Artificial
progress is considered superior to natural progress.</p>

<p>Ward was a monist. He believed in the absolute
unity of nature, from the revolutions of celestial
orbs to the vicissitudes of social customs and laws.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-8" href="#Footnote_XVII-8" class="fnanchor">XVII-8</a>
He held that “life is a property of matter,” and
naïvely declared that “it is simply the result of the
movements going on among the molecules composing
a mass of protoplasm.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-9" href="#Footnote_XVII-9" class="fnanchor">XVII-9</a> Psychic phenomena are
“the relations which subsist among the material
molecules of the brain and nervous system and between
these and the material objects of the outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
world....” Since mind is relational, it is immaterial,
but it has matter for its basis. Relations, however,
constitute the properties of matter, and hence
mind, as well as life, is a property of matter.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-10" href="#Footnote_XVII-10" class="fnanchor">XVII-10</a> The
logical length to which Ward goes in supporting his
monistic doctrine is in itself a proof of his error.</p>

<p>Unlike Comte, Ward believed that man originally
was anti-social and completely selfish. In the
earliest stage of human existence, man lived a life
almost solitary, or at least in small groups.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-11" href="#Footnote_XVII-11" class="fnanchor">XVII-11</a> He
was surrounded by destructive forces both inorganic
and organic. Against the wild and ferocious
beasts he found himself almost physically helpless.
Some of his number overcame their physical defenselessness
by using their “wits.” Through
sagacity and cunning they were able to withstand
the attacks of the wild beasts, to survive, and to
propagate their young. Along with increased cunning
there went an increased brain size in proportion
to size of body, and also an improved brain
structure qualitatively.</p>

<p>This brain development is the essential prerequisite
for perceiving the advantages of association.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-12" href="#Footnote_XVII-12" class="fnanchor">XVII-12</a>
Man early recognized the merits of association, and
moved up from the solitary, or autarchic, stage of
social life to the second, or constrained aggregate
stage. This second stage does not contain the elements
of permanency because of its forced nature.
The tendencies toward association are often counteracted
and at times destroyed by fierce contests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
for the limited natural foods. In contending that
man’s early ancestors were very irascible and quarrelsome
beings, Ward went beyond the limits of
scientific induction. In believing that altruism is
an outgrowth of egoism, Ward again violates the
best scientific thought. The probabilities are that
both egoism and altruism have developed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari
passu</i>, and in part from different causes. During
the second stage human speech became an art. It
was a natural outgrowth of the associational life.</p>

<p>The rise of the rudiments of an established government
marks the beginning of the third period
in human society. For protection, tribes unified
themselves under central controls. Through compulsion
or interest, and for protective reasons,
tribes united; the spheres of social organization
thus were enlarged. But government, which was
established for the purpose of securing peace, became
one of the chief causes of external wars.
Governments, autocratic control, and territory hunger
led peoples into destructive war. The world
is still in this third stage.</p>

<p>But some day, according to Ward, wars between
nations will cease, national prejudices will soften,
diversity of language will be overcome, and all
governments probably will be consolidated into one.
This picture represents the fourth, or ideal, level
of societary life, and may never be attained. Ward
cherishes the strong belief that the present national
stage will be succeeded by the cosmopolitan, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
pantarchic, age. Ward perceives an ultimate triumph
of humanitarian sentiments, which will be
also “a triumph of practical interests, that shall
sweep away the present barriers of language, national
pride, and natural uncongeniality, and unite
all nations in one vast social aggregate with a single
political organization.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-13" href="#Footnote_XVII-13" class="fnanchor">XVII-13</a></p>

<p>Ward’s analysis of social evolution rests on his
conception of the social forces. The primary social
force is desire. Desire is the expression of any of
the native impulses which, at the given moment, has
not been gratified. This striving for gratification
constitutes desire and the moving force in the societary
world. “Desire is the essential basis of all
actions.”</p>

<p>The desires are numerous and complex, but upon
examination lend themselves to classification.
There are two fundamental and primary sets of
desires, the nutritive and the reproductive. The
end of the first is to preserve the individual; and of
the second, to preserve and maintain the race.</p>

<p>“The first desire of all creatures is for nourishment.”
This desire remains dominant throughout
life. The human race, Ward summarizes, spent its
infancy—thousands of years—in the single pursuit
of subsistence.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-14" href="#Footnote_XVII-14" class="fnanchor">XVII-14</a> When the natural food supply
failed, man was forced to be inventive and to labor
or die. Too many individuals in one place meant
either the migration of some individuals or that
others must compel nature through labor to increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
her normal yield of subsistence.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-15" href="#Footnote_XVII-15" class="fnanchor">XVII-15</a></p>

<p>The nutritive desire has led man to labor. Labor,
however, is not the natural condition of man.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-23" href="#Footnote_XVII-23" class="fnanchor">XVII-23</a>
Work, according to Ward, is unnatural and irksome.
The constant spur of hunger transformed
man into a working man. To be useful, however,
work must be continuous and applied steadily to a
given object until that object is attained. This
process is the essence of invention, the highest and
most useful form of labor. Without wings, valuable
weapons of offense and defense, claws for digging,
man has had but one line of advance open to
him, namely, invention, whereby he could overcome
his limitations and master nature.</p>

<p>Ward overlooked what Veblen has called the
instinct of workmanship. Man has a desire to do,
to achieve, to be active—only so can he escape the
terrors of ennui. He secures illimitable enjoyment
from seeing the crude materials of nature change
under the manipulations of his hand and mind into
works of art.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the need of nutrition was probably
the chief factor in the invention of tools and in the
storing of food against the hungry day. These
tools and stores constituted property. Property at
once represented power. The law of acquisition
soon exerted a great force. Intense rivalries in
acquiring property developed. “The grand rivalry
was for the object, not the method; for the end regardless
of the means.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-16" href="#Footnote_XVII-16" class="fnanchor">XVII-16</a> Through the centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
and until the present hour, the morality of obtaining
wealth has rarely risen to the morality of many
other phases of life.</p>

<p>Deception early came into prominence. We deceive
an animal, in order to catch and domesticate
or kill him. We deceive a fellow human being and
take his hard earned property away from him. Society,
blindly, has praised deception even when used
by one individual against the welfare of his fellows.
Society has honored him who could “drive a bargain.”</p>

<p>Ward declared that the desire to acquire property
regardless of the method is as strong as ever.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-17" href="#Footnote_XVII-17" class="fnanchor">XVII-17</a>
The only changes that have come are a mitigation
of the harshness of the method and the rise of compulsory
laws and codes which force individuals to
“drive their bargains” and to practice their deceptions
within prescribed limits. The acquisitive impulses
have created major social evils, as evidenced
by “the exceeding indigence of the poor and the exceeding
opulence of the rich,” and by a relatively
large proportion of non-producing rich people to
the entire number of wealthy.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-18" href="#Footnote_XVII-18" class="fnanchor">XVII-18</a> On the other hand,
those who are poor because they are indolent are
only a small proportion of those who are poor and
industrious.</p>

<p>The evils of acquisitiveness cannot be overcome
by softening the human heart. Ward would
make it impossible for individuals to take away the
property of others by making it to the interest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
all individuals not to act in that way. And then he
would teach them, through the social sciences, that
such conduct is against their own highest development.</p>

<p>Ward pronounced the money-making tendency
one of the most useful and at the same time “one
of the coarsest and cheapest of all mental attributes.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-19" href="#Footnote_XVII-19" class="fnanchor">XVII-19</a>
It is useful because it is “the spur of all
industry and commerce; it provides the leisure
which makes intellectual pursuits possible; it encourages
exploration, discovery, and invention; it
is the basis of all large business undertakings; and
it has been an essential force in the development
of civilization. Since civilization is so exclusively
artificial, money can buy a vast variety of objects
of human desire; hence, the possession of money
is strenuously sought.</p>

<p>On the other hand, money-making confers a
pleasure which after all is sordid.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-21" href="#Footnote_XVII-21" class="fnanchor">XVII-21</a> It often leads
to avarice. It has produced a pecuniary inequality
of mankind which socially admits of little justification.
From a moral viewpoint the great struggle
for pecuniary possession has been man’s greatest
curse.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-22" href="#Footnote_XVII-22" class="fnanchor">XVII-22</a> Because of it, many infants have opened
their eyes as millionaires in a world of boundless
plenty; others (equally worthy) have opened their
eyes as beggars in a world of abject poverty.</p>

<p>Society becomes divided into two main classes:
the industrials and the non-industrials, or parasites.
The non-industrials use their cunning in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
ways.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-24" href="#Footnote_XVII-24" class="fnanchor">XVII-24</a> The leading non-industrial modes of acquisition
are these: robbery, theft, war, statecraft,
priestcraft, and monopoly. This list represents the
chronological order and history of non-industrial
types of acquisition.</p>

<p>Robbery is the coarsest manner of acquisition.
Theft represents the lowest order of cunning.
Wars of conquest are robbery on so large a scale
that they arouse group patriotism. Cunning and
treachery in war have given way to strategy. Statecraft
has often been characterized by the egoistic
attempts of a few shrewd individuals, who have devised
means for supplying the wants of the many,
and appropriated rich rewards for themselves from
“the befriended and grateful community.” Priestcraft
as represented by many of the priests of
Brahma, Buddha, Osiris, Ormuzd, Mahomet and
even Jesus have developed successful modes of acquisition.
They have often stood at the gates of
death, and for pay guaranteed to the stricken and
fearful friends of a departed loved one a safe journey
through the perils following death. Monopoly
takes cunning advantage of a scarcity of the means
of substance, or creates an artificial and false
scarcity. Monopoly has organized the fields of
transportation, exchange, finance, labor, manufacture.</p>

<p>The non-industrials co-operate better than the industrials
and against the welfare of the latter. The
industrials, unfortunately, do not understand the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
principles of co-operation very well and do not have
the intelligence to carry them into practical operation.
They receive less education than the non-industrials;
the years of their industrial apprenticeship
are taken from their school days. After their apprenticeship
begins, the fatigue of their labor gives
them little time or energy for intellectual improvement.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-25" href="#Footnote_XVII-25" class="fnanchor">XVII-25</a>
In pronouncing co-operation the product of
superior intelligence Ward neglects the rôle played
by the gregarious, parental, and related social instincts.
Ward sees only part of the truth when he
calls competition a natural law, and co-operation
artificial. He wisely observes, however, that those
who co-operate thrive at the expense of those who
compete.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-26" href="#Footnote_XVII-26" class="fnanchor">XVII-26</a> In the same way that individuals co-operate
in order to secure their own gain, society
must organize to secure the progress of all.</p>

<p>The second primary set of fundamental forces
is the reproductive. These operate for the future
and for the species. In animals they operate without
arousing shame or modesty. Among human
beings they are manipulated through the agencies
of the reason and the imagination and give rise to
the sentiments of shame and modesty.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-27" href="#Footnote_XVII-27" class="fnanchor">XVII-27</a> They are
so clouded in secrecy that they arouse dangerous
forms of curiosity.</p>

<p>Among animals the choice of mates is largely determined
by the females. In fact, among the lowest
types of animals there are no males. Among certain
higher forms of animal life the male appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
as a mere adjunct. But among human beings, male
sexual selection developed. This change in sexual
selection is one of the differences between the brute
and the human worlds. This transition is explained
by the fact that the higher a being rises in
the scale of development the more sensitive its organs
become, and by the correlated fact that the
male human being through his reason is able to
arouse and satisfy a thousand desires within the
female, and thus cause her to look to him for “that
protection and those favors which he alone can confer.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-28" href="#Footnote_XVII-28" class="fnanchor">XVII-28</a></p>

<p>In the human world the reproductive forces have
first produced a crude sexual love, animal in its
nature, but far-reaching in its basic implications.
Sexual love is an unconscious but dominant factor
in courtship. In its refined form, and modified by
the addition of genuine but often short-lived affective
elements, it becomes romantic love. Romantic
love, according to Ward, unfits lovers for the normal
pursuits of life. While under its spell they
are unable to enjoy anything but each other’s presence.
“The man is unfitted for business, the woman
for social life, and both for intellectual pursuits.
The only spur that can make either party pursue
other things, is the sense of doing something that
the other desires.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-29" href="#Footnote_XVII-29" class="fnanchor">XVII-29</a></p>

<p>In the sense that natural, or sexual, love becomes
the basis of romantic love, so romantic love in turn
represents the genesis of a still higher form of love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
namely, conjugal love. The love of a man for his
wife or of a woman for her husband is, however,
fundamentally different from romantic love. It is
more stable, less disturbing to the normal processes
of life, and makes the home and the family socially
productive institutions. It often reaches a high
state of refinement and develops its beauty of content
from the sharing together by husband and wife
of great joys and sorrows.</p>

<p>Maternal love, an outgrowth of maternity, manifests
startling degrees of courage even among
animals. Under the spur of the need for defending
her young, a mother will often perform miraculous
deeds. In its highest form maternal love manifests
a remarkable strength throughout life and an extra-human
power of forgiveness.</p>

<p>Then there is consanguineal love, which according
to Ward includes paternal and fraternal affections.
It becomes the blood bond or feeling of
attachment that exists among the members of a
primitive kinship group, and it leads to feelings of
race and world solidarity and attachment.</p>

<p>Ward also pointed out that for each of these
forms of love there is a correlative hate. This
force of repulsion is often greater than the correlative
love. Jealousy often leads to violent and destructive
actions. Race hatred frequently becomes
a vicious, brutal, and widespread sentiment that
paralyzes all tendencies toward world progress.</p>

<p>Marriage institutions have developed from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
operation of the reproductive forces. Polygamy,
polyandry, and a score of other types of marriage
have arisen, although monogamy has demonstrated
itself to be the superior type of marriage institution.</p>

<p>The reproductive forces have led to numerous
sexuo-social inequalities. Men and women have
come to occupy separate spheres of activity, and to
represent distinct social conditions.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-30" href="#Footnote_XVII-30" class="fnanchor">XVII-30</a> Although the
two sexes live together and appear to be companions,
they are in fact dwelling in separate worlds
and on different planes. There are several principal
inequalities. (1) There is an inequality of dress,
which has loaded woman with ornaments and
caused her an enormous amount of disease and
suffering. (2) There is an inequality of duties,
which has kept woman confined to the house, and
made a slave or a pampered pet of her. (3) There
is an inequality of education. Society has shut
woman in the past from all opportunities for gaining
knowledge by experience. Moreover, society
has seen fit to debar women from the knowledge
that is acquired by instruction. (4) An inequality
of rights has meant that women have been discriminated
against before the law. Without direct
representation in legislatures, women have suffered
in proprietary matters. (5) A general sex inequality
has at times made woman the property or
the slave of man. In short, women have been
denied, until with recent years, entrance to the
higher intellectual forms of activity and at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
same time denied social and political rights.</p>

<p>Reverting to Ward’s classification of desires, we
may now proceed to a discussion of the third set
of forces, the sociogenetic. In contradistinction to
the nutritive and the reproductive desires, or to the
ontogenetic and the phylogenetic forces, respectively,
the sociogenetic forces lead directly to race,
or social, improvement. The ontogenetic forces
guarantee individual preservation; the phylogenetic,
race preservation; and the sociogenetic, race
and social progress. Ward classified the sociogenetic
forces as moral, esthetic, and intellectual.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-31" href="#Footnote_XVII-31" class="fnanchor">XVII-31</a></p>

<p>Morality is either racial or individual. Race
morality is largely an outgrowth of custom. Duty,
according to Ward, is conduct favorable to race
safety, while virtue is “an attitude of life and character
consistent with the preservation and continuance
of man on earth.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-32" href="#Footnote_XVII-32" class="fnanchor">XVII-32</a> Individual morality
on the other hand, is based on altruism. Altruism
is the expenditure of energy in behalf of other individuals,
and involves the power of representing
the psychic states of others to one’s self. Morality
leads to humanitarianism, whose aim is meliorism.
Meliorism aims to reorganize society so that the
minimum pain and the maximum enjoyment may
be insured. Meliorism is a non-sentimental improvement
or amelioration of the human or social
state.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-33" href="#Footnote_XVII-33" class="fnanchor">XVII-33</a></p>

<p>Ward holds that the esthetic forces consist of a
desire for open or deep-seated symmetrical forms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Behind a landscape which at first appears irregular
and jagged, there is a fundamental symmetry
and balance. Sculpture, painting, and landscape-gardening
are largely imitations of nature. Architecture,
however, emphasizes straight lines, regular
curves, and other symmetrical and geometrical
figures.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-34" href="#Footnote_XVII-34" class="fnanchor">XVII-34</a> Because of the invention of popular musical
instruments, music is open to and enjoyed by
the common people. No such invention, unfortunately,
has taken place in the fields of painting
and sculpture. These realms are limited to the
highest geniuses and “their choicest productions
appropriated by the few who combine wealth with
taste.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-35" href="#Footnote_XVII-35" class="fnanchor">XVII-35</a></p>

<p>The intellectual forces are chiefly the desires to
know. These desires are three-fold: (1) to acquire
knowledge, (2) to discover truth, and (3) to impart
information.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-36" href="#Footnote_XVII-36" class="fnanchor">XVII-36</a> The desire to acquire knowledge is
perhaps strongest in the young. Youth will often
learn anything, without exercising any powers of
discrimination. The gratification of the desire to
discover new truth yields almost divine thrills of
satisfaction. There are four methods of imparting
information to others, viz., (1) by conversing,
(2) by teaching, (3) by lecturing, and (4) by
writing.</p>

<p>In addition to the dynamic forces there is the
directive agent in society, namely, the intellect.
Ward makes a precarious distinction between the
feelings and thought, or between intellect as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
seat of emotion, appetite and motive power, and
intellect as the organ or source of thought and
ideas.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-37" href="#Footnote_XVII-37" class="fnanchor">XVII-37</a> Ward’s psychology is admittedly unscientific.
The thought or ideational phase of the intellect
Ward divorced almost absolutely from the
affective aspects of consciousness. He failed to
perceive the dynamic character of thought and
ideas. He made thought simply the directive agent
in society.</p>

<p>In thought, Ward found the hope of the race.
Thought can restrain and control social energy.
It can produce telic methods of progress which
are immeasurably superior to the blind, ruthless
methods of nature. The procedure of nature with
unlimited resources is “to produce an enormously
redundant supply, and to trust the environment to
select the best.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-38" href="#Footnote_XVII-38" class="fnanchor">XVII-38</a> Nature secures success through
“the indefinite multiplication of chances.” Hence
the survival of the fittest results in a sacrifice of a
great majority—a highly wasteful method. The
method of mind is the reverse. Though prevision,
mind utilizes all the dynamic forces of society, that
is the human desires, in constructive, orderly ways.
Social waste may be reduced, by telic methods, to
a minimum. Mind can perceive the best social ends
and pursue them, whereas nature works blindly.
Thought has in its power the possibility of subjugating
natural forces and turning them into contributors
to human needs.</p>

<p>Ward developed essentially four leading principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
of social dynamics and hence of societal
progress. (1) The first law he called “difference
of potential.” This term, which he borrowed from
physics, refers to the difference in potential possibilities
of individuals. This difference is manifested,
for example, in the crossing of cultures.
It disturbs social stability, and creates social liability.
Sex is a device whereby a difference of
potential is maintained. While asexual reproduction
is characterized chiefly by repetition of forms,
sexual reproduction creates changes in the stock
in countless directions. The difference of potential
which is caused by a crossing of strains is
highly dynamic, resulting in unnumbered variations,
and hence in providing endless opportunities
for progress. In a similar way a cross fertilization
of cultures opens many opportunities for social advancement.
“Progress results from the fusion of
unlike elements.”<a id="FNanchor_XVII-40" href="#Footnote_XVII-40" class="fnanchor">XVII-40</a> Difference of potential, again,
is illustrated in the friction of mind upon mind.
Thoughts conflict, and the result is likely to be an
invention.</p>

<p>Difference of potential may lead to creative synthesis.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-41" href="#Footnote_XVII-41" class="fnanchor">XVII-41</a>
When two elements are joined, the result
is usually more than the sum of the parts. The
combining of hydrogen and oxygen in given proportions
produces water, which manifests characteristics
that are not possessed by either of the constituents.
Likewise, the combining of two ideas
by the human mind may result in a new idea, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
thus in progress.</p>

<p>(2) A second dynamic principle is innovation,
which has its biological homologue in the sport, or
mutant. Throughout nature and society, fortuitous
variations occur. Life at times breaks over the
bounds of pure heredity—the result is innovation.
Variation, in the sense of mutation or innovation,
appears to be due to the exuberance of life. At
times nature appears to react against being bound
by rigid laws of heredity, to defy her own rules,
and to become rampant.</p>

<p>Social innovation is invention. New ideas often
appear accidentally. The mind in its exuberance
coins new phrases, catches new glimpses of reality,
and creates ideas which are contrary to all that is
established and supposedly true.</p>

<p>(3) Ward’s third law of progress is called conation.
This concept refers to social effort which is
carried on naturally to satisfy desire, to preserve
or continue life, to modify the surroundings. In
satisfying normally the gregarious desires, the individual
advances the cause of social progress. In
preserving the life of the child, the mother presumably
contributes to the welfare of the race.
The sacrifices which parents make in behalf of children
are efforts which further the welfare of
society. Every constructive modification of either
the physical or spiritual environment benefits mankind.
Conation is thus a term which covers a multitude
of activities that are performed in the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
course of daily life, and which unconsciously
to the doers are adding to the sum total of human
welfare.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth dynamic principle which Ward
described has already been discussed, namely, the
principle of social telesis. The possibilities in social
telesis are illimitable. Social telesis can turn the
passions and desires of men into socially useful
channels. These passions are bad only when directed
to wrong ends. They are like fire—they can
destroy or they can refine. If individuals as members
of society could develop prevision and work
together for societary ends, they would be able to
transform the world.</p>

<p>Ward believed that greatness does not rest so
much in intellectual power as in emotional force.
He had great faith in persons of average intellectual
ability who are ambitious. It thus becomes the
part of wisdom for society to educate wisely the
average intelligence. Ward challenged the idea
that only a very few persons are geniuses and that
these individuals, by virtue of their superior abilities,
will uniformly overcome their environments.
He held that genius is largely a matter of focalization
of psychic energy, and that by this process all
individuals may have the honor of contributing
something valuable to civilization.</p>

<p>Ward pointed out that geniuses are as likely to
appear in one social stratum as in another, among
the poor as among the healthy, in the hovel as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
the palace. He also demonstrated how society
allows genius and talent to be ruthlessly destroyed
among the lower classes through denial of opportunity.
As a solution for this problem, Ward advocated
social distribution, that is, the distribution
of all useful knowledge to all humanity everywhere.
A scientific system needs to be perfected for the
more thorough and equal distribution of the great
volume of valuable knowledge which has already
been discovered. Ward was a strong advocate of
the socialization of education.</p>

<p>In an article which appeared in the month following
his death, Ward discussed his idea of social
progress under the terms, eugenics, euthenics, and
eudemics.<a id="FNanchor_XVII-42" href="#Footnote_XVII-42" class="fnanchor">XVII-42</a> He supplemented a theory of sound
birth with a theory of sound environment. The
practical result in society would be a state of eudemics,
or a society of sound people.</p>

<p>Ward was an advocate of sociocracy. By sociocracy
he did not mean a democracy or a rulership
that is likely to be conducted selfishly by the individuals
who exercise sovereign power. Sociocracy
connotes a rulership of the people in which each individual
is governed primarily not by his own interests
but by the interests of society.</p>

<p>Achievement was a large concept in Ward’s
mind. He made “achievement” one of the chief
goals of human life. By achievement in behalf of
human progress individuals gain social immortality.
The masses of humanity are achieving little or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
nothing in behalf of society.</p>

<p>In this treatment of Ward’s sociological thought
it has not been the aim of the writer to enter upon
a dissertation regarding the abstract and philosophic
implications that are involved in the subject
matter. Neither has he attempted a polemic against
the weaknesses in Ward’s thinking, except to note
the defective monistic philosophy and the erroneous
“faculty” psychology. It has been his purpose to
let the strong, constructive elements in Ward’s system
of sociology speak clearly and effectively for
themselves.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Anthropologic Sociology</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Additional light upon the nature of sociological
thought may be secured by consulting the anthropologists,
and particularly, the students of social
origins. The last mentioned group of scholars
have been unusually successful in making valuable
contributions to sociological thought, because they
have used the psychological approach.</p>

<p>For more than a century the anthropologists
have been searching for materials and advancing
theories concerning the origin of man, of conflict
and co-operative tendencies, and of the early ideas
and institutions of the human race. They have
been aided by the investigations of the geologists
and especially of the paleontologists. The ethnographers
and ethnologists have also discovered important
data. The findings of all these groups of
investigators, as far as they relate to the main
thread of this book, will be here treated essentially
as a unitary contribution. There is not space to deal
specifically with the work of anthropologists, such
as Tylor, Morgan, Pitt-Rivers, Haddon, Frazer,
Goldenweiser, Keane, and a number of other prominent
authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>Anthropological social thought will be indicated
here under several headings. As far as possible the
controversial and technical theories in anthropology
will be avoided. Certain of the ideas that have been
advanced by Sumner, Westermarck, Hobhouse,
Wundt, Boas, and Thomas will receive special attention,
because they are unusually pertinent to the
main theme of this volume.</p>

<p>1. There is common agreement among anthropologists
that man is the descendant of a branch of
higher animal life, and that the creation of man took
place by a slow, evolutionary process. The slowness
of this developmental process does not necessarily
lessen the mysterious or miraculous character
of it. It places the origin of the human race at
a much earlier date than was once supposed—perhaps
from 200,000 to 500,000 years ago. The animal
inheritance of man need not lead anyone to
deny the correlative fact that man possesses spiritual
qualities not common to the highest developed
animals.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-1" href="#Footnote_XVIII-1" class="fnanchor">XVIII-1</a></p>

<p>Even the psychic equipment of man can be
traced in its origins to the primates with their individual
and social instincts. The instinctive bases of
human conduct are hundreds of thousands of years
old. They are so intrinsically a part of human
nature that no discussion of current social problems
will neglect the imperiousness of the ancient
instinct heritage of the human race.</p>

<p>2. There is extensive anthropologic evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
that mankind had a common origin. The remains
of the earliest human beings are found in a region
which extends through India from Java to England.
From these geographic centers primitive man
seems to have migrated in various directions—northeast,
southwest, and finally to the Western
Hemisphere. Different climatic and environmental
conditions affected the migrating groups in different
ways. Those who migrated into the tropical
regions were retarded because of the enervating
climatic factors. Those who reached the frigid
zone were also retarded, or subjected to recidivism
for a different reason—a harshness of living conditions
and an excess of environmental obstacles.
The north temperate zone with its fertile lands and
its invigorating climate afforded the proper <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i>
for the development of the race.</p>

<p>3. An important question relates to the alleged
potential equality of all races. The common origin
of races is admitted, but the question remains open
whether, for example, the African races possess the
same innate mental abilities as the Caucasian races.
The controversy here is sharply drawn between the
environmentalists and the eugenists. Each side of
the debate has collected a large body of evidence.
In reality, the question apparently boils down to
this: Have the many centuries of living under the
enervating torrid zone conditions effected the African
races so deeply that under favorable cultural
circumstances they have become incapable of developing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
beyond a certain mental level which is
lower than that attained by the Caucasian races? In
the past the answer to this question has been a
strong affirmative. The bulk of the evidence that
has been collected in recent years indicates that the
affirmative answer is incorrect.</p>

<p>4. It is becoming clear that every race is a composite
of several races. Ethnological data show
that the five grand divisions of the human race may
be subdivided into racial stocks, and into races and
sub-races, until more than 600 races may be described;
and furthermore, that each of the 600 or
more races represents an amalgamation of at least
three or four races. It is evident that no clear line
of racial demarcation can be drawn, and that purity
of race may be a fictitious term.</p>

<p>5. Intermarriage of the representatives of races
belonging to similar racial stocks seems advisable—according
to the ethnologist. Pure bloods apparently
die out. The strongest races today are those
in which amalgamation has taken place recently—that
is, within one thousand or two thousand years,
for example, the English, or the Scotch-Irish.</p>

<p>A mooted question of world importance relates
to the intermarriage of the representatives of races
widely different, such as the white and the yellow
races, or the white and the black races. No race
has yet developed out of such combinations. Race
prejudices and social distinctions have produced
conflicts which thus far have prevented the formation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
of such a race. Very few scientific data are
available regarding miscegenation.</p>

<p>Apparently, the interbreeding of whites and
blacks leads ultimately to the elimination of the
racial characteristics of the blacks and to the complete
dominance of the whites. There are some
writers who assert that this process takes place to
the gain of the lower race and to the loss of the
higher race. The last-mentioned point has not yet
been proved. Miscegenation between whites and
blacks occurs under such abnormal and vicious
social conditions that the racial tendencies are definitely
obscured.</p>

<p>6. Conflict between races is primordial; conflict
between races today is illustrated in national wars
and race persecutions. Weaker races have often
combined against a stronger race; from these experiences
there has come a growing sense of the
value of co-operation. Nations with high moral
principles have united against a powerful neighbor
nation with bullying tendencies. Out of these temporary
combinations there has arisen a sense of
need for permanent forms of national co-operation.
This common need will ultimately lead, undoubtedly,
to a permanent association of nations.</p>

<p>The conflict between the grand divisions of the
human race will probably continue for a long time
to come. Sometimes it is concentrated in an antagonism
between the white and yellow races; and
again, it is expressed in the more fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
struggle between Occidentalism and Orientalism.</p>

<p>7. The origin and development of primitive
ways of doing constitute a well-cultivated field of
study. Anthropologists have published an endless
amount of materials on the origin of languages,
religions, occupations, sex distinctions. A portion
of this work has been done without an accurate understanding
of the psychological principles that are
involved, and hence has to be viewed with caution
or neglected entirely.</p>

<p>W. G. Sumner, whose argument in favor of individualism
and of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i> governmental policy
was given in <a href="#Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a>, published in his <i>Folkways</i>
a minute and extended account of the nature of
primitive institutions.</p>

<p>In the development of his theories, Sumner began
with the needs of primitive peoples and with the attempts
to meet these needs. Repetition of these acts
leads to established ways of doing, that is, to folkways.
Folkways are “the widest, most fundamental,
and most important operation by which the
interests of men in groups are served.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-2" href="#Footnote_XVIII-2" class="fnanchor">XVIII-2</a> Societal
life consists chiefly in making folkways and applying
them. Even the science of society might be defined
as the study of folkways. Folkways are the
product of the trial and failure method of meeting
needs. They tend to become firmly established
and to be passed on from generation to generation.
They become traditional. They acquire all
the authority which is attached to the memory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
respected ancestors. Even the ghosts of ancestors
stalk the earth keeping guard over the folkways.
The folkways carry with them the conviction that
they are essential to human welfare. It is this conviction
which gives them the force of <em>mores</em>. Thus
the folkways are not purposeful methods of securing
progress but unconscious ways of meeting current
exigencies; they are blindly and rigorously
forced upon successive generations.</p>

<p>8. Races are guilty of ethnocentrism.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-3" href="#Footnote_XVIII-3" class="fnanchor">XVIII-3</a> Each
race considers itself the center of mankind. It
judges all other races by its own standards, and not
by a higher standard that is determined by data
that are representative of the best interests of all
races. Ethocentrism compels each race to exaggerate
the importance of its own folkways and to
depreciate the folkways of other races. For example,
the Romans and Greeks called all outsiders
“barbarians.” The Jews considered themselves “the
chosen people,” and the Romans and Greeks as
“pagans.”</p>

<p>9. Sumner divided the chief motives of human
action into four classes: Hunger, sex passion,
vanity, and fear (of ghosts and spirits). Behind
each of these motives there is a set of interests.
(1) Hunger led primitive man to invent simple
weapons and tools, such as arrows and hoes, and
then to produce and hoard more complex forms of
wealth. A strange peculiarity of wealth is its effect
on its creator; it seems to be stronger than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
its creator. It often bears him down to a slavish,
materialistic, and even selfish existence. Labor in
the struggle for existence is irksome and painful.
Wealth and labor, however, are both commendatory
when they are used to increase human welfare.
In this statement Sumner overlooked the fact
that wealth in order to be commendable must also
be produced under constructively social conditions,
and that labor in order to be praiseworthy must in
its exercise be individually helpful. In other words,
Sumner’s test of the use to which wealth and labor
are put is incomplete.</p>

<p>Sumner gave a new meaning to the term, slavery.
He held that “men of talent are constantly forced
to serve the rest. They make the discoveries and
inventions, order the battles, write the books, and
produce the art.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-4" href="#Footnote_XVIII-4" class="fnanchor">XVIII-4</a> Sumner deplored the tendency
to call whatever one does not like by the name of
slavery. He felt that marriage slavery, rent
slavery, sin slavery are terms which are coined by
a too easily disgruntled people.</p>

<p>(2) The sex passion leads to sex <em>mores</em> which
cover the relations of men and women to each
other before marriage and in marriage, and the
obligations of married persons to society. The sex
<em>mores</em> determine the nature of marriage and of divorce.
Sumner derided sex equality. Man has a
more stable nervous system than woman, is more
self-absorbed, more egoistic, less tactful. Since
man has greater physical strength than woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
woman was educated by circumstances in primitive
days to adapt herself to the stronger sex, and to win
by developing charms where her lack of comparative
strength rendered her helpless. Resignation
and endurance thus became acquired traits of
women.</p>

<p>Neither renunciation nor license is the proper
method of control of the sex passions. Both produce
unnecessary agony. License, for example,
“stimulates desire without limit, and ends in impotent
agony.” Sumner advocated temperance and
regulation—a regulation which comes from knowledge
and judgment.</p>

<p>Women by necessity must bear an unequal share
in the responsibilities of sex and reproduction.
Likewise, men must bear an unequal share of the
responsibilities of property, war, and politics. For
the latter types of duties women are hampered by
a delicately adjusted and cumbersome generative
system which men do not possess.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-5" href="#Footnote_XVIII-5" class="fnanchor">XVIII-5</a></p>

<p>Formerly women yielded to the will of men. Today,
the marital state is one of endless discussion,
a defeat for one party or the other, with unpleasant
effects upon life and character. In ancient times
women took pride in the supervision which their
husbands exercised over them and valued themselves
as hidden treasures.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-6" href="#Footnote_XVIII-6" class="fnanchor">XVIII-6</a> This protected
position was considered aristocratic. Under polygamy,
women looked with pity and disgust upon
the man who cannot, or is unwilling to, support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
more than one wife.</p>

<p>At this point it is interesting to note that W. I.
Thomas has distinguished between the sexes on the
basis of differences in metabolism—men being katabolic
and women anabolic. Man consumes more energy
than woman.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-7" href="#Footnote_XVIII-7" class="fnanchor">XVIII-7</a> He is better fitted for bursts
of energy, while woman possesses more endurance.
Man’s structural variability is toward motion;
woman’s, toward reproduction. Hence man seems
to have been assigned in primitive society to tasks
requiring violence and exertion, whereas to women
fell the work requiring constant attention.</p>

<p>Civilization thus far has largely profited by the
intelligence of man. If to this situation it will develop
and add the intelligence of women, it will be
supplanted by a higher type of civilization. Under
these conditions a large percentage of marriages
will represent “the true comradeship of like
minds,” instead of being frequently, as now, an arrangement
in which woman is treated as a pet.</p>

<p>(3) The motive of vanity is all-powerful. “One
likes to be separated from the crowd by what is
admired, and dislikes to be distinguished for what
is not admired.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-8" href="#Footnote_XVIII-8" class="fnanchor">XVIII-8</a> To satisfy vanity, barbarian
mothers “deform their babies toward an adopted
type of bodily perfection.” Aristocracies grow up
out of appeals to vanity. An aristocracy is a group
of persons closely united who define the possession
of things for which they are admired and which
the masses do not possess. Vanity leads to all types<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
of absurdities and indecencies in dress. Teeth are
knocked out for the sake of appeasing vanity. An
Indian woman puts a board on the forehead of her
baby to make the forehead recede.</p>

<p>(4) Fear as a motive rules the lives of primitives.
Fear of ghosts and spirits is peculiarly enslaving.
Pestilence, defeat in war, bodily pain were
all considered the result of the wrath of the gods.</p>

<p>The mass phenomena of fear are especially pitiful.
Manias of various types rule whole masses.
Witchcraft thrived for centuries on the strength of
fear. Pilgrimages and crusades were partly due to
fear; demonism was a product of fear. When fear
became firmly established in the folkways, it acted
as an ever-ruling tyrant. In the <em>mores</em> it became
firmly entrenched and was a leading factor in
moulding character. Through religious practices
and dogmas it defined a “hell” and ruled with a
fearful hand.</p>

<p>10. Upon simplest analyses, according to Sumner,
four societal values stand out with clearness:
intellectual, moral, economic, and physical.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-9" href="#Footnote_XVIII-9" class="fnanchor">XVIII-9</a> Each
of these, however, is composite. The highest societal
value seems to result from a harmonious combination
of the four values enumerated. The best
member of society is he in whom the intellectual,
moral, economic, and physical values are more or
less equally and harmoniously represented.</p>

<p>11. Sumner divided society into five main
classes.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-10" href="#Footnote_XVIII-10" class="fnanchor">XVIII-10</a> (1) The masses represent social mediocrity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
They are of average social usefulness. (2)
Then there are the dependent and defective classes—a
drag upon society but not harmful or vicious.
(3) The delinquent classes are grossly harmful.
They are anti-social and a grievous burden. (4)
Above the masses there are the people of talent,
and (5) above the talented are the geniuses. “A
man of talent, practical sense, industry, perseverance,
and moral principle is worth more to society
than a genius who is not morally responsible, or
not industrious.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-11" href="#Footnote_XVIII-11" class="fnanchor">XVIII-11</a></p>

<p>It is a mistake to think of the masses as being
at the base of society; they are located at the core.
They are traditional, conservative, and the bearers
of the <em>mores</em>. The lowest sections of the masses
are a dead weight of ignorance, disease, and crime.</p>

<p>12. A social institution is composed of an idea,
notion, or interest, and a resultant structure. The
primary institutions are property, marriage, and
religion.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-12" href="#Footnote_XVIII-12" class="fnanchor">XVIII-12</a> These began as folkways; they became
customs. Social institutions can be modified only
when the <em>mores</em> are changed; they develop rituals,
which are ceremonious, solemn, and strongest when
perfunctory and when exciting no thought.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-13" href="#Footnote_XVIII-13" class="fnanchor">XVIII-13</a></p>

<p>Sumner boldly asserted that nothing but might
has ever made right, and that nothing but might
makes right now.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-14" href="#Footnote_XVIII-14" class="fnanchor">XVIII-14</a> The fact that property began
in force is not proof that property is an unjust
institution. Marriage and religion also began in
force, but the element of justice in the existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
of these institutions is not seriously questioned today.
Sumner, however, did not discriminate between
force as an agent or a tool, and force as a
primary cause. He did not distinguish clearly between
hate and love as the dynamic factors behind
action that is decisive. He did not set forth the
distinction between harsh, material, immutable
force and a kindly, spiritual, attracting love.</p>

<p>13. The persistency of folkways and <em>mores</em> is
illustrated in a thousand ways by Sumner. He described
(1) their slow variability under changed
life conditions, (2) their sudden variability under
revolutionary conditions, (3) the possibility of
changing them by intelligent action, (4) the problems
involved in adjusting one’s self to the <em>mores</em>
of another group, (5) the conflicts between the
<em>mores</em> of different groups.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-15" href="#Footnote_XVIII-15" class="fnanchor">XVIII-15</a></p>

<p>The <em>mores</em> are powerful engines of societal selection.
The most important fact about the <em>mores</em>
is the power which they exert over the individual.
He does not know their source. He is born into
them. He accepts them in his early years uncritically.
His habits and character are moulded by them.
If in adult life he challenges them, he is ostracized
by his group, labeled unpatriotic, and even trodden
under foot.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-16" href="#Footnote_XVIII-16" class="fnanchor">XVIII-16</a> The <em>mores</em> develop powerful watch-words,
slogans, and even epithets of contempt and
disapproval which only the most independent and
courageous individuals dare to face.</p>

<p>14. Ideals are entirely unscientific, declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Sumner.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-17" href="#Footnote_XVIII-17" class="fnanchor">XVIII-17</a> They are phantasies little connected with
fact. They are often formed to pacify the restless,
or to escape settling a question justly in the present.
The “poor” are told to look to the next life for their
rewards. The radicals are urged to accept the
Christian virtues of meekness and lowliness. Ideals
are useful, chiefly, in homiletics, in self-education
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">via</i> auto-suggestion, in satisfying vanity, in marriage.
In these observations, Sumner undoubtedly
pointed out genuine weaknesses in ideals. He underestimated
the psychological fact that they spring
from the very real affective phases of consciousness,
and that they can be projected rationally. He
was right, however, in deploring the chasm which
exists between ideals and practices, and in showing
how ideals may become encysted in literature although
not in the <em>mores</em>. “The Greeks proved that
people could sink very low while talking very
nobly.”</p>

<p>Immorality is conduct contrary to the <em>mores</em> of
the time and place.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-18" href="#Footnote_XVIII-18" class="fnanchor">XVIII-18</a> Chastity is conformity to the
current taboo on the sex relation. “Modesty is reserve
of behavior and sentiment.” Even “nakedness
is never shameful when it is unconscious,” that
is, when there is no consciousness of a difference
between fact and the rule set by the <em>mores</em>.</p>

<p>Sumner deduced an important principle when he
asserted that the “<em>mores</em> can make anything right.”
The <em>mores</em> give usages a certain order and form,
and cover them with a protecting mantle of propriety.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
The sanction of the <em>mores</em> is utilized by
the class in power in order to maintain the established
régime, even though it be one of injustice.</p>

<p>Sumner decried the importance which is ordinarily
attached to book learning,<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-19" href="#Footnote_XVIII-19" class="fnanchor">XVIII-19</a> because it is addressed
to the intellect rather than to the feelings
which are the springs of action. The real education
is that which comes through personal influence and
example. It is derived from “the habits and atmosphere
of a school, not from the school textbooks.”</p>

<p>15. Despite Sumner’s failure to appreciate the
significance of a thoroughgoing psychological approach
to an analysis of folkways, his description
of these societal phenomena constitutes a unique
and valuable contribution to social thought. Sumner’s
rigorous attitude toward social life did not
permit him to enter into an extensive interpretation
of the folkways in the light of folk ideals. He dealt
with what <em>is</em> to the exclusion of what <em>ought to be</em>.
He saw the past so clearly, and the present so much
as a reflection of the past, that no enheartening
forward look was possible. He rested his theories
on the inexorable work of the laws of biological
evolution, modified chiefly by his belief in a strong
individualism.</p>

<p>Sumner’s fundamental theses have been developed
and modified by A. G. Kellor. Professor
Kellor has projected the Darwinian principles of
variation, selection, transmission, and adaptation
into societal concepts. In fact, he has done this so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
well that he has given the Darwinian principles full
sway, not allowing sufficiently for the rise and
operation of complex psychic principles. He has
made the folkways the connecting link between
organic and societal evolution, but has not noted
fully the new, countless, and often intangible but
powerful factors by which societal evolution is
characterized.</p>

<p>16. The rôle that concepts of conduct have
played in the evolution of society, has been analyzed
by E. A. Westermarck and L. T. Hobhouse. The
former is usually known as an anthropologist, and
the latter as a sociologist. Professor Westermarck
has shown that, strictly speaking, a custom is not
merely the habit of a certain group of people; it
also involves a rule of conduct.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-21" href="#Footnote_XVIII-21" class="fnanchor">XVIII-21</a> It possesses two
characteristics—habitualness and obligatoriness.</p>

<p>Not every public habit, however, is a custom, involving
an obligation.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-22" href="#Footnote_XVIII-22" class="fnanchor">XVIII-22</a> There may be certain practices
which are more or less common in society, but
which at the same time are generally condemned.
The disapproval of these is as a rule not very deep
or genuine.</p>

<p>Dr. Westermarck has indicated that there is a
close similarity between the conscience of a community
and of an individual.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-23" href="#Footnote_XVIII-23" class="fnanchor">XVIII-23</a> If a group commits
a sin twice, it is likely to be considered allowable.
In order to get at the real nature of societal life,
the “bad habits” as well as the professed opinions
of groups must be examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>“Society” says Dr. Westermarck, “is the birthplace
of the moral consciousness.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-24" href="#Footnote_XVIII-24" class="fnanchor">XVIII-24</a> Emotions
which are felt by the community at large tend to
take the form of conduct standards. The moral
emotions lead to a variety of moral concepts.
These fall into two main classes: concepts of disapproval,
such as the concepts, bad, vice, wrong;
and concepts of approval, such as good, virtue, and
merit.</p>

<p>Professor Westermarck is convinced of the
tremendous influence that religious beliefs have
exerted upon the moral ideas of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-25" href="#Footnote_XVIII-25" class="fnanchor">XVIII-25</a> This
influence has been exceedingly varied. Religion has
taught the principles of love and yet has indulged
in cruel persecutions. It has condemned murder
and yet been a party to child sacrifice. “It has emphasized
the duty of truth-speaking, and has itself
been a cause of pious fraud.” Professor Westermarck
has contributed to social thought not only in
his valuable descriptions of the rise and evolution
of moral ideas, but also in his <i>History of Human
Marriage</i>, to which reference will be made in <a href="#Chapter_XXIV">Chapter
XXIV</a>.</p>

<p>The writings of L. T. Hobhouse reveal a thorough,
comparative study of the conduct rules of
mankind. Professor Hobhouse has described the
evolution of ethical consciousness as displayed in
the habits, customs, and principles that have arisen
in human history for the regulation of human conduct.
He has shown how, in the lowest forms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
the organic world, behavior is regulated, and directed
to some purpose.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-27" href="#Footnote_XVIII-27" class="fnanchor">XVIII-27</a> This behavior is somewhat
definitely determined by the structure of the
organism itself.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-28" href="#Footnote_XVIII-28" class="fnanchor">XVIII-28</a></p>

<p>There are three forces which may be called
social, or which tend to keep society together.
These social bonds are: (1) the principle of kinship,
(2) the principle of authority, and (3) the
principle of citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-29" href="#Footnote_XVIII-29" class="fnanchor">XVIII-29</a> Kinship is the moving
force in primitive society. The principle of authority
becomes prominent when one tribe captures and
enslaves a weaker group. This principle is also invoked
in order to secure an integration of openly
diverse attitudes within the group, even of modern
national groups. It is exemplified in the various
forms of absolutism in government. The principle
of citizenship finds expression when certain individuals
within the group are delegated to perform
as servants and ministers of the public as a whole.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-30" href="#Footnote_XVIII-30" class="fnanchor">XVIII-30</a>
Personal rights and the common good are the two
reigning ideals. Every individual is recognized as
having a right to the conditions requisite for the
full development of his social personality. The
good in life consists “in the bringing out into full
bloom of those capacities of each individual which
help to maintain the common life.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-31" href="#Footnote_XVIII-31" class="fnanchor">XVIII-31</a> The third
principle, that of citizenship, when carried to its
conclusion reveals the possibility of a world state.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-32" href="#Footnote_XVIII-32" class="fnanchor">XVIII-32</a></p>

<p>It is the contention of Professor Hobhouse that
there is a close connection between the growth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
law and justice and the prevalent forms of social
organization. Organized law has developed out of
a sense of community responsibility, which, however,
has expressed itself as a rule in crude ways,
and without distinguishing between accident and
design. This sense of community responsibility in
primitive groups tends to hold in check the spirit
of anarchy and of self-redress. Sooner or later,
the method of community self-redress yields to the
authority of a chief or of a council representing
the whole community.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-33" href="#Footnote_XVIII-33" class="fnanchor">XVIII-33</a> Ultimately the community
develops a special social organ for adjusting disputes
and preventing crime. It is then that the
ethical idea becomes separated from the conflicting
passions of the collectivity. Thus, the foundations
are laid for true judicial inquiry by evidence and
genuine proof, and for a system of scientific public
justice.</p>

<p>17. In applying the principles of folk psychology
to the anthropologic field, William Wundt
has developed a new method and new theories.
Folk psychology is the study of “the relations
which the intellectual, moral, and other mental
characteristics of peoples sustain to one another.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-34" href="#Footnote_XVIII-34" class="fnanchor">XVIII-34</a>
The term was originated by Lazarus and Steinthal,
whose works will be referred to again in <a href="#Chapter_XXII">Chapter
XXII</a>. In the masterpiece on the <i>Elements of
Folk Psychology</i>, Wundt has given a psychological
description of the main processes and institutions
in society, tracing them from their beginnings in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
the processes of nature; he has made a survey of
human progress. His study opens with a discussion
of the processes which produced the digging stick,
the club, and the hammer; it ends with an analysis
of world empire, world culture, world religions, and
world history. The intervening ages are the totemic
and the age of heroes and gods.</p>

<p>World empire affected primarily the material
aspects of the life of peoples. It led to world intercourse,
which in turn multiplied the needs of peoples.
These multiplied needs were followed by exchanges
of the means of satisfying the needs. The
external and material phases of culture are survived
by the spiritual phases—thus world culture
is a sequence of world empire. It may be said that
the vicissitudes of peoples under the rule of the
world empire idea brings forth a unified history.
World culture in turn creates a common mental
heritage for mankind.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-36" href="#Footnote_XVIII-36" class="fnanchor">XVIII-36</a></p>

<p>In the establishment of a world culture, world
religions are the leading forces. They have been
foremost in creating the idea of a universal human
community. In particular, Christianity is based on
a belief in a God who makes no distinction between
race or class or occupation. Consequently, “it has
regarded missionary activity among heathen peoples
as a task whose purpose it is finally to unite
the whole of mankind beneath the cross of Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-37" href="#Footnote_XVIII-37" class="fnanchor">XVIII-37</a></p>

<p>For a long time in human history, religious
development was considered to be the main connecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
link—such was the contention of St. Augustine.
In 1725, Vico argued that the development
of language and jurisprudence is of universal import.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-38" href="#Footnote_XVIII-38" class="fnanchor">XVIII-38</a>
Finally, world history has become an account
of the mental life of peoples—“a psychological
account of the development of mankind.”</p>

<p>18. The work of Professor Wundt is similar in
many ways, although characterized by a distinctive
starting point and by many differences, to the contributions
of Franz Boas and W. I. Thomas. Professor
Boas has declared his belief in man’s ability
to dominate the laws of organic evolution as expressed
in human life. He has brought forward
a large amount of evidence in support of the theory
that environment has caused differences between
races. He has pointed out that race prejudice is
largely a product of social environment, and that
under changed conditions of life it has little place
in the world. Boas is a strong advocate of the
theory, already advanced in this chapter, that all
races are potentially equal in ability, and that they
would demonstrate the truth of this statement, if
given a common cultural background and social
opportunities. He has advanced the idea that “the
organization of mind is practically identical among
all races of men.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-39" href="#Footnote_XVIII-39" class="fnanchor">XVIII-39</a></p>

<p>Professor Boas has amassed considerable evidence
to show that in the matter of inhibition of
impulses, of power of attention, of ability to do
original thinking, primitive man compares favorably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
with civilized man. Inasmuch as the social
environment is powerful and education is effective
in making over social environments, education can
raise all races to the same high level, and at the
same time unify them upon the same knowledge
bases. This contention is similar to the position
that Professor Hobhouse has made clear, namely:
“While race has been relatively stagnant, society
has rapidly developed.” Moreover, social progress
is determined not by alterations or racial type, but
by modifications of social cultures.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-40" href="#Footnote_XVIII-40" class="fnanchor">XVIII-40</a> These modifications
are caused primarily by the interactions of
social causes.</p>

<p>19. Noteworthy pioneering in the field of social
anthropology and social origins has been done by
W. I. Thomas. He has developed the theory that
progress results from “crises.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-41" href="#Footnote_XVIII-41" class="fnanchor">XVIII-41</a> As long as life
runs along smoothly, a lack of interest is likely to
ensue. The result is ennui. But a crisis in any of
the life processes arouses the attention, that is, produces
a concentration of psychic energy. A disturbance
of any habit is a crisis. When the exigences
of the crisis are solved through a focalization
of consciousness, the situation is said to be
controlled by the individual, who again lapses into
a state of disinterestedness until another disturbance
of habit occurs. The new method of control
will be imitated. If imitated widely, it will mark a
rise in the level of civilization.</p>

<p>It will be observed at once that the power of attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
to meet crises is largely an individual matter
and that the rôle of the individual is very
important. The group level of culture limits the
power of the mind to meet crises and to make
adjustments.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-42" href="#Footnote_XVIII-42" class="fnanchor">XVIII-42</a> The mind is limited by the psychic
fund which the group already possesses. If there
is no knowledge of mathematics in the group, then
a large banking system is impossible. Crises, attention,
control—these are the three leading concepts
in Thomas’ theory of social origins.</p>

<p>Control is the object of all purposeful activity.<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-43" href="#Footnote_XVIII-43" class="fnanchor">XVIII-43</a>
It is the end, and attention is the means. An animal
differs from a plant in that it has a superior control
over a larger environment than does the plant.
“It does not wait for food, but goes after it.” Man
differs from an animal partly in the fact that his
fore limbs are free to secure new and varied forms
of control. Moreover, man through his mind has a
superior instrument of control. By the use of
knowledge, mind is effective in controlling factors
that are present in neither time nor space. Through
its inventions, such as language, religious creeds,
mechanical appliances, forms of government, man
has risen to a high level of civilization.</p>

<p>Thomas has analyzed the social process in terms
of social attitude and social values. An attitude is
a process of individual consciousness that determines
“the real or possible activity of the individual
in the social world.”<a id="FNanchor_XVIII-45" href="#Footnote_XVIII-45" class="fnanchor">XVIII-45</a> A social value, on the other
hand, is any datum that has an empirical content<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
accessible to the members of a social group and a
meaning which may make it an object of activity.
Activity is thus the bond between a social attitude
and a social value. The value is the meaning which
a material or spiritual datum may have. An attitude
is a real or implied going out after value.
Social psychology is the science of social attitudes.
At this point anthropologic social thought has
merged into social psychology.</p>

<p>Until twenty-five years ago, anthropology interpreted
societary origins pretty largely in terms of
the individual. With the use of a social psychology
such as Cooley represents, “anthropology has given
more accurate explanations and become essentially
a social anthropology.”</p>

<p>Before we discuss the different phases of psycho-sociologic
thought, it will be well to make clear the
recent advances that have been made in the biologic
phases of social thought. The center of attention
in this field is the relation of the laws of heredity
to human progress, which constitutes the problem
in eugenics. A discussion of eugenic social thought
will bring forward in a scientific way the chief elements
of an intellectual situation that was left, in
<a href="#Chapter_XVI">Chapter XVI</a>, in the unsatisfactory Spencerian
formulae. A presentation of eugenic social thought
will give a valuable background to the discussion
which follows concerning psycho-sociologic
thought.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Eugenic Sociology</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Eugenic social thought is the child of biological
discoveries. Eugenics, the science of good breeding,
which did not achieve scientific standing until
the closing years of the last century, may be traced
back in its incipient forms to Plato, who advocated
that strength should mate only with strength, and
that imperfect children should be eliminated from
society. In its scientific origins eugenics dates from
1859, when Darwin’s <i>Origin of Species</i> was first
published. Its beginning as a distinct field of human
thinking is found in the articles by Francis
Galton on “Hereditary Talent and Genius,” which
appeared in 1865; and in 1869, in book form under
the title, <i>Hereditary Genius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-1" href="#Footnote_XIX-1" class="fnanchor">XIX-1</a></p>

<p>Eugenic social thought deals with the operation
of the laws of heredity in society. It was a part of
this field which Francis Galton made world-known
by his treatises on <i>Hereditary Genius</i> and <i>Inquiries
into the Human Faculty</i>.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-2" href="#Footnote_XIX-2" class="fnanchor">XIX-2</a> In 1904, Galton wrote a
paper entitled: “Eugenics; Its Definition, Scope and
Aims.” In this dissertation the new science of
eugenics was formally introduced to the world.
Gabon’s analysis of eugenics became its leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
interpretation.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-3" href="#Footnote_XIX-3" class="fnanchor">XIX-3</a></p>

<p>The mantle of the founder fell upon Professor
Karl Pearson, whose work at times has assumed a
distinctly statistical nature. Professor Pearson’s
leaning toward biometry has brought severe criticism
upon him. The statistical approach, while
exact and thought-provoking, is subject to various
errors in interpretation of data. The viewpoint
from which Professor Pearson writes, however, is
not one-sided. For example, he states that “it may
require years to replace a great leader of man, but
a stable and efficient society can only be the outcome
of centuries of development.”<a id="FNanchor_XIX-4" href="#Footnote_XIX-4" class="fnanchor">XIX-4</a> He holds that
group conscience ought for the sake of social welfare
to be stronger than private interest, and that
the ideal citizen should be able to form a judgment
free from personal bias.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-5" href="#Footnote_XIX-5" class="fnanchor">XIX-5</a></p>

<p>C. W. Saleeby, another English writer, has developed
an independent reputation as a eugenist.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-6" href="#Footnote_XIX-6" class="fnanchor">XIX-6</a>
In the United States, such men as C. B. Davenport<a id="FNanchor_XIX-7" href="#Footnote_XIX-7" class="fnanchor">XIX-7</a>
and Paul Popenoe have made important eugenic
contributions. The recent tendency has been to be
wary of purely statistical studies of heredity and
to rely more definitely upon case studies. However,
since eugenics is directly indebted to the studies of
heredity and since heredity must be investigated for
several generations, eugenic social thought has not
yet developed far.</p>

<p>Galton defined eugenics as the science of good
breeding. Its aim as a pure science is to study the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
agencies under social control “that may improve or
impair the racial qualities of future generations,
either physically or mentally.” Galton’s program,
as outlined by the founder shortly before his death,
insisted upon (1) a study of the laws of heredity,
(2) a dissemination of knowledge about heredity,
(3) a study of the factors underlying marriage,
(4) a study of birth rates, and (5) a case study of
individual families.</p>

<p>Eugenic social thought holds that heredity among
human beings operates according to the same laws
that govern heredity among animals. The theory
of Mendelian units becomes in practice the theory
of multiple factors. The unit characters, upon
analysis, appear to be complex and to be inherited
in complex ways. Multiple factors are inherited
from generation to generation directly when pure
factors are united with pure factors. But when the
pure is united with the hybrid, then the laws of
dominance and recessiveness operate. In such combinations
certain factors tend to express themselves
in greater proportion than do other elements. This
failure to secure expression in a given generation,
however, means that the specific factor is recessive
for the time being. Later, it will likely appear.</p>

<p>Galton stated another important eugenic law, the
law of regression. Each peculiarity is inherited by
the offspring on the average in a slightly less degree
than it is found in the parent. Hence, according
to Galton, good traits and poor traits alike are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
inherited in a degree nearer mediocrity by the offspring
than by the parents. This law partially explains
why gifted men rarely have sons who are
equally gifted. The law seems to hold good for
large numbers, but not when considered in relation
to single families. It serves as a check upon variation
and mutation.</p>

<p>Galton and Pearson advanced another statistical
law, the law of ancestral inheritance. Galton supposed
that the parents contribute to the child one-half
of his inherited factors, the grandparents one-fourth,
and so on. Pearson has secured statistical
evidence which shows that Galton’s geometric series
is incorrect, and that on the average in a large
number of cases the parents together contribute
to the child .624 of his traits; the four grandparents,
.198; the eight great grandparents, .063; and
so on.</p>

<p>The law of mutation, described by de Vries and
other geneticists, refers to the appearance of mutants,
or individuals who do not reproduce to form
but represent a new line of heredity. In this way
the appearance of genius may often be accounted
for. However, the factors which explain the appearance
of mutants have not yet been analyzed.</p>

<p>Another fundamental genetic consideration is the
law of selection. If individuals with worthy traits
mate only with individuals who possess worthy
traits, a superior stock will be produced. This tendency
is very important, since it points the way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
a potent method of securing social progress.</p>

<p>Eugenic social thought has been developed in part
on the basis of the Weismann theory of no or slight
transmission of acquired traits. The germ-plasm
is transmitted from individual to offspring in a direct
line of descent. Injuries to the parent rarely
change the nature of the germ-plasm. Only extreme
malnutrition or excessive use of alcohol apparently
exerts a definite influence on the germ
cells. Nature has thus made provision for the
protection of germ-plasm, whether strong or defective.
Society, then, may encourage the mating
of individuals who possess strong physical and mental
traits, and discourages the mating of individuals
who are defective—thus securing its own positive
improvement.</p>

<p>Eugenic social thought follows two courses. Restrictive
eugenics advocates the segregation of the
so-called dysgenic classes, such as the feeble-minded,
the insane, and the grossly defective criminal.
Public opinion reacts against sterilization;
injustice that cannot be remedied may be done
through the use of sterilization. Segregation by
sexes, while involving expense, is a satisfactory
eugenic method of safeguarding society against the
reproduction of dysgenic persons.</p>

<p>The other trend of eugenic thought supports the
raising of the standards of choice in mating. Constructive
eugenics, as distinguished from restrictive
eugenics, urges a program of education whereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
young people will habitually rate one another by
physical and mental standards rather than by
wealth and class standards.</p>

<p>Eugenics disapproves of random mating. It
favors assortative mating, because, for example,
the “marriage of representatives of two long-lived
strains ensures that the offspring will inherit more
longevity than does the ordinary man.”<a id="FNanchor_XIX-9" href="#Footnote_XIX-9" class="fnanchor">XIX-9</a> Eugenics
thus stresses the importance of teaching young
people eugenic ideas, and of training them to be
guided by these ideals rather than by caprice and
passion.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-10" href="#Footnote_XIX-10" class="fnanchor">XIX-10</a> Eugenic ideals include health, paternity
and maternity, and pleasing disposition. Education
and character are secondary eugenic ideals of importance.</p>

<p>A study of the birth rate shows that the inferior
stocks and classes of individuals produce many
more children than do the superior groups. Many
cultured people do not marry, or if they marry they
keep the birth rate very low. As a result, the racial
character of a whole people may change within a
few generations. The superior strains may be lost
and the inferior furnish the entire population.</p>

<p>The low birth rate of the superior stocks is due
to several factors: (1) The lengthening period of
education and of professional training calls for the
postponement of marriage. (2) The desire to give
children the best advantages limits the birth rate.
(3) The increasing spirit of independence on the
part of women causes a postponement of marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
and a limitation of the number of children. These
and other causes have produced a differential birth
rate in favor of the inferior strains. Eugenic
thought urges that the differential be reversed in
favor of the superior strains. This conclusion implies
that the dysgenic classes must be prevented
from producing children, that the poor must be
raised to higher educational and economic levels and
taught to limit the birth rate, and that the eugenically
superior be taught to increase the birth rate.</p>

<p>Eugenics pronounces war to be both dysgenic and
eugenic.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-11" href="#Footnote_XIX-11" class="fnanchor">XIX-11</a> (1) It is dysgenic in that the bravest
and the physically best are killed first. In the case
of a long war only the weakest men physically and
mentally are left alive to propagate the race. (2)
War is dysgenic in that it produces a large number
of hurried marriages. Rational choices of mates
are supplanted by sudden emotional reactions. (3)
War is dysgenic in that sex immorality greatly increases.
Prostitution flourishes in the neighborhood
of military encampments, unless rigid means
of control are established. (4) Again, the dysgenic
effect of war is seen in the period of socio-mental
unrest which always follows war, and which
among other things undermines rational sexual selection.</p>

<p>The chief eugenic effect of war is manifested
during the period of training. This preparation
period accents the importance of a strong physique
and health measures. An insipid, stoop-shouldered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
population of city young men may be transformed
into an army of fit soldiers. However, the conclusions
are obvious that the dysgenic effects of war
are far more potent than the eugenic gains, and that
the eugenic advantages may he acquired in other
ways than by promulgating war.</p>

<p>Eugenics looks askance at the feminism movement.
Feminism once meant the development of
the womanly traits of the sex. It now refers to the
elimination as far as possible of sex differences.
It would make women as nearly as possible like
men. Eugenics objects to this trend, since it underestimates
the importance of the fact that women
physically are built to be mothers. To the extent
that women enter into all the occupations, they will
become men-like; and their efficiency as mothers of
the race will decrease, and the race will suffer.</p>

<p>The economic equality of the sexes is a satisfactory
doctrine to the eugenist if the doctrine is extended
to make motherhood a salaried occupation,
like mill work or stenography.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-12" href="#Footnote_XIX-12" class="fnanchor">XIX-12</a> “Child-bearing
should be recognized as being as worthy of remuneration
as any occupation which men enter, and
should be paid for (by the state) on the same
basis.”<a id="FNanchor_XIX-13" href="#Footnote_XIX-13" class="fnanchor">XIX-13</a></p>

<p>Eugenics would throw every possible safeguard
around motherhood, especially in the period immediately
before and after the birth of the child. The
mother, even the expectant mother, “is doing our
business, indispensable and exacting business, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
we must take care of her accordingly. She is not
only a worker but the foremost of all workers.”<a id="FNanchor_XIX-14" href="#Footnote_XIX-14" class="fnanchor">XIX-14</a></p>

<p>Eugenic thought as represented in the writings
of C. W. Saleeby has denominated alcohol, venereal
disease, and tuberculosis as “racial poisons.” While
there is some doubt regarding the eugenic effects
of taking small amounts of alcohol into the human
body, eugenists are agreed that alcohol, when taken
in excess quantities, affects the germ-plasm and produces
a neurotic taint. It appears that alcoholism
may be a cause in producing defective children.
The verdicts of hygiene and economics that alcoholism
is injurious to the race is supported by eugenics.</p>

<p>Venereal disease, another so-called racial poison,
produces toxins which apparently affect the germ-plasm
indirectly if not directly. It lowers the
physical and moral tone and causes unfavorable
racial tendencies. Venereal disease tends to destroy
the generative organs and to cut off the birth rate
entirely. It is a result of sex immorality which in
itself tends to produce children under such abnormal
conditions of vice that it becomes an anti-social,
if not a dysgenic factor, in society. To the extent
of course, that venereal disease kills off the racially
useless, it may be considered eugenic.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-15" href="#Footnote_XIX-15" class="fnanchor">XIX-15</a> Such a
point of view, however, fails to rate properly the
invasions which venereal disease is continually
making upon normal and superior types of germ-plasm.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis weakens the membranous tissues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
and probably leads in a few generations to an unusual
degree of susceptibility to the invasion of
tubercle bacilli. It is still a question, however, to
what extent tuberculosis may be counted a racial
poison. Professor Hobhouse has argued that, by the
development of scientific hygiene, it will be possible
to center attention not upon eliminating a tubercular
stock but upon eliminating the tubercle bacilli.<a id="FNanchor_XIX-16" href="#Footnote_XIX-16" class="fnanchor">XIX-16</a></p>

<p>In regard to race questions the social anthropologist
and the eugenist represent different poles
of thought. As was indicated in the preceding
chapter, the social anthropologists, such as Boas
and Thomas, support the theory of potential race
equality. The eugenist, on the other hand, contends
that there are inherently superior and inferior
racial stocks, and that the marriages of representatives
of inferior stocks with representatives of
superior stocks will produce children of a stock distinctly
lower than that of the superior stocks. The
eugenists in the United States hold that the immigration
of the southern and eastern peoples of Europe
will not only supplant through a higher birth
rate the native stock of Nordic origin but, where
marriages between natives and southern and eastern
European immigrants occur, it will lower the racial
quality of the population. While eugenic thought
in this matter deserves a complete and respectful
hearing, it must be considered along with the findings
of social anthropology.</p>

<p>Eugenic thought opposes the miscegenation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
the Caucasian and African. The Negro, it is contended,
is not only different from the Caucasian
but as a rule is eugenically inferior, judged by
the achievements of the Negro. Moreover, the
eugenist interprets the anthropological tests to
show that the innate ability of a colored man “is
proportionate to the amount of white blood he has.”
The conclusion of eugenics is that “in general the
white race loses and the Negro gains from miscegenation,”<a id="FNanchor_XIX-17" href="#Footnote_XIX-17" class="fnanchor">XIX-17</a>—as
far as the germinal natures of
the two races are concerned. The eugenist would
forbid all intermarriage between the races, and urge
that the taboo against sexual intercourse between
the races be extended.</p>

<p>In the light of eugenic thought genealogy may
become scientific, in fact, it may become a valuable
source of scientific materials for eugenics. Heretofore
genealogy has been the concern of a few
leisure-class people, who have taken pleasure and
pride in recounting the fact that some one of a
possible thousand or more ancestors several generations
back was distinguished in some way or other,
and who would have friends or the public believe
that they inherited from this ancestor of note the
characteristics which made him great. Eugenics
points out a nobler purpose to which genealogy may
be put. It urges that mental and physical traits of
every individual in all families be carefully analyzed
and accurately and systematically recorded. In this
way it will be possible in a generation to have available<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
a large amount of eugenic materials, and in a
few generations a reliable body of data for studying
racial heredity.</p>

<p>The debate regarding the comparative influences
of nature and nurture has been long and bitter.
It may be said here that both heredity and environment
are more or less equally essential in the development
of human personality. Without inherited
factors in the individual the environment has
nothing upon which to work. Without a stimulating
environment the inherited traits will remain
dormant. Each human being has inherited factors
which, if played upon by certain environmental factors,
may lead the individual to try to wreck society
or himself or both. Every person, also, has traits
which, if stimulated by the proper environmental
elements may cause him to develop into a useful
member of society. While the environment cannot
change the inherited potentialities very much, if
any, it is a prime factor of vast importance in determining
which inherited tendencies will never find
expression, which will be expressed in modified
ways, and which will reach full fruition. Eugenics
insists with increasing force that educational programs
shall provide that every child be not only well
reared but also well born. A weakness in eugenic
thought is that it implies that sound racial stock is
sufficient to guarantee progress; it tends at times
to overstress an aristocracy of racial stock. It
sometimes detracts from the importance of character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
and moral discipline as essential elements in
social progress.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Conflict Theories in Sociology</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The concept of social conflict has already been
introduced to the reader. In the chapter on Individualistic
Social Thought the prolonged struggle
between individual rights and genuine social control
was analyzed. Malthus described the conflict
between population and the means of subsistence.
Comte insisted that man is not naturally a social
being. Hence this unsocial nature of mankind is
a fruitful source of human conflict. Marx pictured
the class struggle; and Darwin elaborated the doctrine
of the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>The slightest grasp of social thought reveals the
fact that human association is characterized at
times by deep-seated and subtle conflicts; and at
other times by a fundamental co-operative spirit.
Some sociological writers have seen only or chiefly
the conflicts of life; others have sought out the co-operative
activities; still others have tried to discover
the relationships between conflict and co-operation
in societal development. This chapter
will deal with the concept of social conflict, while
the next chapter will be centered on the ideal of
social co-operation and upon the relationship of conflict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
to co-operation in group processes.</p>

<p>One of the outstanding believers in the theory
that conflict dominates societal life was Ludwig
Gumplowicz (1838–1910). His system of thought
begins with the assertion that primitive hordes were
the original units of society. Gumplowicz dissented
from Herbert Spencer’s belief in the individual as
the original societary unit, although he accepted the
determinism that is inherent in Spencer’s theory of
evolution. Gumplowicz also repudiated Comte’s
belief in social amelioration through prevision, but
subscribed to Comte’s positivism.</p>

<p>According to Gumplowicz, society began with a
large number of primitive groups, which were self-sustaining
and self-conscious units. Each one of
these hordes was a warring group, possessing an
instinctive hatred of all other hordes.<a id="FNanchor_XX-1" href="#Footnote_XX-1" class="fnanchor">XX-1</a> As these
hordes increased in size, the general food supply
failed to meet the needs. Consequently, inter-group
struggle resulted and the members of the weaker
hordes were either destroyed or enslaved. The
existence of slaves led to situations of intra-group
inequality, which in turn created problems involving
justice and injustice.</p>

<p>As a result of continual conflicts between groups,
there are frequent changes taking place in their
personnel. The vanquished are continually being
absorbed by victorious groups. In a given successful
group two classes are at once established,
namely, the victors and the vanquished. Classes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
are thus continually arising out of new juxtapositions
of heterogeneous racial elements.<a id="FNanchor_XX-2" href="#Footnote_XX-2" class="fnanchor">XX-2</a></p>

<p>It was in an intense form of group self-interest
that Gumplowicz found the mainspring of social
progress. This self-interest leads to an exaggerated
group appraisement, a strong degree of
group unity, a state of warfare between groups—and
perhaps progress. Basic to this group self-interest,
there are the material needs of the members
of the group; the economic desires and the
occupational interests; and the moral and spiritual
tendencies. The group is bound together by various
factors, such as a common social life, a common
language, religion, and culture.</p>

<p>Gumplowicz advocated a theory of potential race
equality. He argued against innate racial superiority
and racial inferiority. He doubted the existence
of any pure races. Each race is a compound
of other races, and hence races are potentially
similar in fundamental respects. National progress,
therefore, holds no connection with race purity.</p>

<p>Gumplowicz minimized the importance of the
individual. Society rules. Centuries of traditions
dominate. The thoughts of the individual are
almost, if not entirely, a mere reflection of the social
environment. The group develops group pride or
group disloyalty in the minds of its members. The
distinguished leader is largely the man who expresses
the will of the group during the group
crisis. Gumplowicz makes only a brief reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
to the process of interaction between the individual
and the group.<a id="FNanchor_XX-3" href="#Footnote_XX-3" class="fnanchor">XX-3</a> An underlying theory of natural
determinism vitiates much of Gumplowicz’s ideas
concerning the individual.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as society, like individuals, passes
through a cycle of growth and decay, subject to
unchangeable natural and societary laws, there is
no justification for individual interference with
social processes. In fact, this theory led Gumplowicz
into pessimistic conclusions concerning life.
He failed to see that societal life is not necessarily
a series of hopeless cyclical conflicts, and that social
processes are becoming increasingly subject to
human control—for good or ill. He did not appreciate
the fact that groups are not subject to laws
of cyclical growth and decay after the manner of
individuals. Hence, his conflict theory of societal
life ended in confusion and pessimism.</p>

<p>A reference was made in <a href="#Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a> to the
theories of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900). This
German philosopher developed the idea of social
conflict, basing it on the concept of the “will to
power.” Leaders desire power. They enjoy to
exercise power and they thrive under that exercise.
Jealousy of the leaders arises. The weaker members
of society join together against the possessors
of power. They develop a will to power, but of a
weaker type than that of the leaders. Conflicts
ensue between the will to power of the superior and
the will to power of the inferior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>The superior and the inferior types each possess
a distinctive code of morality.<a id="FNanchor_XX-4" href="#Footnote_XX-4" class="fnanchor">XX-4</a> The supermen
develop a harsh and rigorous attitude toward themselves
and others. They gird and prepare themselves
for the crises of life. They strive to augment
their power. They become self-contained.
They take pride in crushing weakness and in deifying
strength. Their morality stresses those factors
in life which create power. They feel a condescending
pity for the weak. They experience no sense
of responsibility for the inferior classes. Since
supermen are the supreme goal of nature, supermen
feel that all persons and things should contribute
to increasing the power of supermen.<a id="FNanchor_XX-5" href="#Footnote_XX-5" class="fnanchor">XX-5</a> It is
a waste of energy for supermen to give their lives
in behalf of inferior persons. They are interested
only in the welfare of other supermen.</p>

<p>The morality of the inferior is of a type which
furthers weakness. It accents sympathy. It emphasizes
gregariousness. The inferior create a
slavish, cringing, meek morality. They sacrifice
themselves readily and humbly in behalf of others
who may be inferior to themselves.</p>

<p>Nietzsche believed in a eugenics program. He
declared that marriages should be arranged with a
view to producing supermen. Nietzsche’s deterministic
view of natural evolution led him to believe,
however, that equality of privileges is unattainable.
He opposed democracy because its
theory of equal opportunities contradicts the tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
of nature. He was no socialist. He asserted
that an aristocracy of power is the only true
goal for society. He carried forward the ruthless
biological laws of tooth and fang into his conception
of the highest types of civilization.</p>

<p>Moreover, the superman is a biological mutant.
He appears sporadically. At this point Nietzsche’s
inconsistency becomes obvious. For example, if
geniuses appear sporadically and without reference
to biological laws, why attempt to arrange marriages
so as to produce supermen? To get himself
out of the dilemma, Nietzsche postulated cyclical
returns of supermen and lost his bearings in trying
to interpret an endless circular movement in social
evolution, endlessly repeating itself. In an applied
form Nietzsche’s philosophy has appeared in German
political life, but to the defeat of Germany.</p>

<p>In starting points, Nietzsche and Gumplowicz
were widely different. Nietzsche began with an
apotheosis of the man of power and extolled the
achievements of supermen. Gumplowicz had little
place for the individual, even for the most powerful.
Both sets of theories ended in a deterministic
philosophy of individual and social despair.</p>

<p>An unusually fundamental delineation of social
conflict has been advanced by Simon N. Patten in
his <i>Theory of Social Forces</i>.<a id="FNanchor_XX-6" href="#Footnote_XX-6" class="fnanchor">XX-6</a> Human society is the
product largely of a pain economy in which the
requisites for survival are determined “by the enemies
and pains to be avoided.” In a like manner a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
pain morality and a pain religion develop. The purpose
of the pain morality is “to keep persons from
committing acts and putting themselves in situations
which lead to destruction.” The pain religion,
likewise, aims to invoke the aid of higher powers
in the human conflict with enemies and death. The
social forces in a pain economy have been builded
up in the form of sets of ideals, instincts, and
habits.</p>

<p>Society, however, is now in a transition stage—entering
a pleasure economy. A large number of
the sources of pain have been eliminated through
the inventive and administrative phases of civilization.
Dangerous beasts and reptiles, barbarous invasions,
and superstitious interpretations are uncommon
among the advanced human groups.</p>

<p>No nation, unfortunately, has been able to live
under a pleasure economy. Its members have not
built up sets of instincts, habits, and ideals that
withstand the effects of a pleasure economy. Consequently,
individuals and nations have fallen into
lethargy, vice, and decay. The enemies in a pleasure
economy are found within the individual; these
are as yet unconquered under the allurements of a
pleasure environment. In discussing the conflicts
between these habits and ideals, Dr. Patten may
err in implying that the race once was not in a pain
economy and hence did not originally develop out
of such an environment, but he nevertheless has
analyzed an important societal fact in his pain-pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
transition concept.</p>

<p>Another type of conflict theory of society is advanced
by Thomas Nixon Carver. Professor Carver
begins his analysis with a discussion of the conflict
of human interests. Originally all conflicts
were settled on the basis of might. But conflicts
between persons who are beginning to think, sometimes
lead one or each of the contending parties to
a consideration of adjusting the conflict by other
than physical strife. At this point the concept of
justice begins to take form.</p>

<p>Justice, according to Dr. Carver, is “that system
of adjusting conflicting interests which makes the
group strong and progressive.”<a id="FNanchor_XX-7" href="#Footnote_XX-7" class="fnanchor">XX-7</a> Virtue and
strength are pronounced identical, and strength is
defined “according to its ability to make itself universal.”</p>

<p>Conflict arises out of scarcity. Where two men
want the same thing, conflict ensues. It is this antagonism
of interests which produces moral problems
and furnishes a basis of determining justice
and injustice. One reason for the lack of supply
of things which people seek is that in society human
wants are unduly expended. If wants could be kept
low and production high, an adaptation of people
to things would take place which would greatly
lessen conflict.</p>

<p>Conflicts take place in three different fields: (1)
between man and nature, (2) between man and
man, and (3) between the different interests of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
same man.<a id="FNanchor_XX-8" href="#Footnote_XX-8" class="fnanchor">XX-8</a> If there were no such conflicts, there
would be no moral problems. The result would be
paradise.</p>

<p>The institutions of property, the family, and the
state have developed out of antagonism of interests,
which in turn, as has been said, is the result of
scarcity. If things were not scarce, no one would
think of claiming property in anything. In a similar
way the kinship group becomes desirous of possessing
property and hence acquires unity. In asserting
that <em>the</em> unifying principle in the family is
an economic one, Dr. Carver espouses a theory of
economic determinism. In fact, he holds that “the
economic problem is the fundamental one, out of
which all other social and moral problems have
grown.”<a id="FNanchor_XX-9" href="#Footnote_XX-9" class="fnanchor">XX-9</a></p>

<p>Dr. Carver somewhat softens his rigorous social
theories when he admits that there may be a few
people in the world whose feeling of humanity is
strong enough to overbalance an antagonism of interests
and to lead them to treat the world as a normal
individual treats his family.<a id="FNanchor_XX-10" href="#Footnote_XX-10" class="fnanchor">XX-10</a> A world of such
people would make a world of communism. But
such a world is unthinkable, because world-loving
people are social aberrations. The individual whose
altruism is such that he gladly gives his body to a
tiger, is not helping to transform the world into a
world of saints but into a world of tigers.<a id="FNanchor_XX-11" href="#Footnote_XX-11" class="fnanchor">XX-11</a> Extreme
forms of benevolence and meekness constitute
the very food upon which selfishness fattens.<a id="FNanchor_XX-12" href="#Footnote_XX-12" class="fnanchor">XX-12</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<p>Professor Carver, therefore, points out two
sources of conflict, namely, scarcity of desirable
things and self-centered appreciation. These two
bases of conflict are fundamentally natural and normal.
Conflicts appear, however, in a great variety
of forms. This classification of the methods of
struggling for existence is fourfold.<a id="FNanchor_XX-13" href="#Footnote_XX-13" class="fnanchor">XX-13</a></p>

<p>(1) There is a group of conflicts which are primarily
destructive, such as war, robbery, dueling,
sabotage, brawling. These conflicts are all crude,
primitive, brutal. They represent man at his lowest
ebb. They are militant in character, depending
upon the individual’s power to destroy, to harm, or
to inflict pain and injury.<a id="FNanchor_XX-14" href="#Footnote_XX-14" class="fnanchor">XX-14</a></p>

<p>(2) Deceptive conflicts are of an order slightly
higher than the militant. They include thieving,
swindling, adulteration of goods, false advertising.
They imply a greater degree of intelligence than the
purely destructive types of conflict.</p>

<p>(3) Another form of conflict is persuasive in
character, for example, political, erotic, commercial,
and legal conflicts. Political competition includes
seeking governmental appointments, running for
office, campaigning for a political party. Erotic
conflicts are in the main different forms of courtship.
Commercial persuasion utilizes the agencies
of advertising and salesmanship. Legal conflicts
include litigations in the courts. In all these illustrations
the individual strives to further his own
interests by his persuative ability. Oftentimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
resort is made to cheap persuasive methods, such
as demagogy or political claptrap. Sometimes the
persuasion falls to the level of deception and, occasionally,
to destructive depths.</p>

<p>(4) The highest form of conflicts are the productive
types. Some productive conflicts refer to
rivalries in producing economic goods; others to
rivalries in rendering service. In his <i>Essays in
Social Justice</i>, Professor Carver discusses three
forms of economic competition at length. Here he
includes competitive production, competitive bargaining,
and competitive consumption of economic
goods. The second class has already been referred
to as commercial persuasion. Competitive production
increases the supply of economic goods and
“always works well.” Competitive consumption,
however, “always works badly.” It means “rivalry
in display, in ostentation, in the effort to outshine
or to outdress all one’s neighbors, or at least not to
be outshone or outdressed by them.” It is usually
deceptive; it has no productive features about it.
It may even assume a form of waste and destruction.
The highest type of conflict is friendly rivalry
in rendering service to other people.</p>

<p>Professor Carver would have self-interest direct
its efforts toward the welfare of the nation. Since
neither law nor government can eliminate self-interest,
the next best thing is to connect it with
national well-being. Nearly all useful things that
are done in a community are undertaken through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
self-interest.<a id="FNanchor_XX-15" href="#Footnote_XX-15" class="fnanchor">XX-15</a> Even co-operation is a form of competition.<a id="FNanchor_XX-16" href="#Footnote_XX-16" class="fnanchor">XX-16</a>
The purpose of co-operation is to enable
groups of individuals to compete more effectively
against opposing groups.</p>

<p>Competition is not an evil in itself. The spirit
which dominates competition is the important thing.
Some people are motivated by the pig-trough philosophy,
which emphasizes struggle for the sake of
possession and consumption of goods. The workbench
philosophy accents “action and not possession,
production and not consumption.”</p>

<p>These theories, excellent in many particulars,
apparently do not rate at full value the fact that
education and love can and do modify the self-interest
of the individual, and at the same time direct
the attention of the individual toward unselfish
service. In stressing service through achievement
and production, they neglect to emphasize achievement
through service. Competition in rendering
unselfish service is underrated.</p>

<p>It was Novicow, the Russian sociologist, who
laid bare the alleged benefits of war, showing
that the gains which come from war may be obtained
through other methods of social interaction.<a id="FNanchor_XX-17" href="#Footnote_XX-17" class="fnanchor">XX-17</a>
Novicow argued forcefully that the real
enemies of a group of people are disease germs and
death, not the best people of other nationality
groups. Novicow’s vision enabled him to perceive
the foolishness of men who lock themselves together
in destructive conflict, when the real enemies are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
microscopic disease bacteria and the gaunt black
specter of death.</p>

<p>Conflict bulks large in the sociology of Edward
A. Ross. Any interference with the carrying out
of the individual’s plans and with the satisfying of
his interests creates opposition. The best characteristic
of the phenomenon of opposition is that it
awakens and stimulates.<a id="FNanchor_XX-18" href="#Footnote_XX-18" class="fnanchor">XX-18</a> Competition operates
according to psychologic laws; for example, the intensity
of competition varies according (1) to the
degree of personal liberty, (2) to the rate of social
change, and (3) inversely as the efficiency of the
selective agents.<a id="FNanchor_XX-19" href="#Footnote_XX-19" class="fnanchor">XX-19</a></p>

<p>One of the most important forms of competition
is found in industrialism. The invention and adoption
of the power-driven machine has created an
industrialism which is moulding and transforming
society in startling ways, and which is causing “its
members more and more to cluster at opposite poles
of the social spindle.”<a id="FNanchor_XX-20" href="#Footnote_XX-20" class="fnanchor">XX-20</a> Professor Ross expresses
slight hope that the ownership of industrial capital
will be disseminated through the working class according
to the conflict rules of the present economic
system.</p>

<p>Other conflict theories will be presented in the
following chapters; for example, the conflict theories
of Gustav Ratzenhofer and Albion W. Small
will be noted in the chapter on co-operation concepts,
and Gabriel Tarde’s analysis of conflict will
be taken up in the discussion of psycho-sociological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
thought.</p>

<p>In general, the social conflict doctrines, when
carried to the extreme, fail to recognize that conflict
and co-operation are correlative social processes.
Humanly speaking, one is as old as the other. Both
spring from the deepest types of human needs.
While the earliest types of associative life may
have been characterized by a predominance of conflict,
the highest stages are ruled by the co-operative
spirit. This transition together with the leading
co-operation theories of social progress will be
taken up in the chapter which follows.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say here that conflict and competition
are essential to social advance. They are both
highly useful when operating in the fields of production
and service.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Co-operation Theories in Sociology</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of the first persons to work out a systematic
interpretation of co-operation was Giovanni Vico
(1668–1744), an Italian philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-1" href="#Footnote_XXI-1" class="fnanchor">XXI-1</a> Vico rejected
the social contract idea because he believed that it
was a false interpretation of the true principle of
co-operation. The concept of a social contract embodied
an artificial and metaphysical notion of
social life.</p>

<p>In his chief work, <i>Principles of a New Science
Concerning the Common Nature of Nations</i>, Vico
inaugurated a study of actual social phenomena.
He sought to discover possible social laws. He attempted
to cast aside the accidental social elements
and to organize the regularities of social
phenomena into laws. He searched for the laws
governing the growth and decay of societies. He
undertook to analyze the history of human society.</p>

<p>Although Vico’s important treatise was not
known outside of Italy until a century and a half
after it was originally published, it contained a
statement of the factor which is basic to any sound
co-operation theory of social progress. Vico was
one of the first writers to describe the principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
that all human groups have a common nature. His
comparative studies of human institutions everywhere,
led him always to the belief in the common
mind of mankind, a concept which in recent years
has been ably elaborated by D. G. Brinton. For
this contribution Vico has been called “the father
of sociology.”</p>

<p>According to Vico, the fundamental social movement
is a gradual unfolding or evolution of social
institutions in response to the common needs of
people. Society owes its development in part to
the reflections of the wise, as the social contract
theorists have said, but also to the human feelings
even of the brutish. This natural sociability of
man has furnished the chief basis for the rise and
development of the spirit of co-operation.</p>

<p>The natural sociability of human beings has led,
more or less unconsciously on the part of man, to
the establishment of necessary social relations and
institutions. The purpose of social organization is
to produce perfect human personalities. Vico outlined
the evolutionary character of society according
to the spiral theory, namely, that society does return
upon itself but that, when it completes a cycle,
it is upon a higher plane of co-operation than when
the given cycle began. Vico also made religion a
necessary principle of progress. Although in adjusting
himself to the prevailing theological dogmas
of his time, Vico committed serious scientific errors,
he nevertheless is deserving of special credit for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
emphasis upon the common nature and natural
sociability of mankind.</p>

<p>Hugo Grotius (1583–1645), the celebrated Dutch
scholar, gave to social thought the international
concept. He advanced the idea of the coming co-operation
among the nations—nations which in his
time were moved primarily by jealousy and hatred
in their relations with one another. Grotius was
the originator of a definite set of principles and
laws for international co-operation. His work in
this regard accentuated the importance of like-mindedness
in matters of international polity.</p>

<p>Spinoza, whose contributions regarding the concept
of sovereignty have already been stated,
declared that the instinct to acquire is naturally
stronger than the tendency to share. Hence, man
must be educated to perceive the advantages of co-operative
living. When this appreciation occurs,
when the advantages of co-operation become clear,
then man will sublimate his egoistic and self-seeking
desires to altruistic communal living. As man
comes to understand, step by step, the values of
co-operative conduct, he will overcome, degree by
degree, his selfish impulses.</p>

<p>The references which were made in <a href="#Chapter_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>
to the work and writings of certain socialists, such
as Robert Owen, form another link in this discussion
of the development of the co-operation concept.
While the experiments in consumers’ co-operation,
such as the activities of the Rochdale Pioneers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
have had splendid success in many countries, they
have demonstrated that they can flourish only in an
environment where the co-operative spirit rules.
While the experiments in producers’ co-operation
have often failed and have not yet as a class been
successful, they have testified to the absence of a
developed co-operative spirit rather than to the
failure of the principle upon which they are based.</p>

<p>Peter Kropotkin, whose opposition to socialism
was indicated in <a href="#Chapter_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>, rendered a useful
service in writing his <i>Mutual Aid; a Factor in
Evolution</i>. Kropotkin, a loyal Darwinian, protested
against the falsely labeled “social Darwinianism.”<a id="FNanchor_XXI-3" href="#Footnote_XXI-3" class="fnanchor">XXI-3</a>
Kropotkin made plain that Darwin’s interpretation
of evolution, while stressing the struggle
for existence, also pointed out that there is in evolution
a powerful tide of co-operation. The logical
conclusion of this treatment of evolution, according
to Kropotkin, is not a phase of “social Darwinianism”
with its emphasis upon a biological struggle
in the highest human realms, but a world of human
association in which the co-operative spirit has risen
to a position of control over physical force and
selfish desire.</p>

<p>Kropotkin studied animal life extensively and
concluded that, although there was among animals
a severe struggle against a heartless Nature, there
was essentially no bitter struggle for existence
“among animals belonging to the same species.”<a id="FNanchor_XXI-3a" href="#missing" class="fnanchor">XXI-3</a>
There is no pitiless inner war for life within this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
species, and moreover, this alleged war is not a condition
of progress. War, declared Kropotkin, is
not a condition of social progress.</p>

<p>Kropotkin considered the clan and the tribe
rather than the individual or even the family the
starting point of society. The tribe itself developed
a morale on the basis of beliefs in its common origin
and in the worship of common ancestors. Then
the possession in common of certain lands served
to arouse new tribal loyalties. These loyalties expressed
themselves in the form of “con-jurations,”
sworn agreements, and ultimately in fraternities
and guilds for mutual support. Kropotkin believed
that primitive man was naturally peaceful, and that
he fought from necessity rather than from ferocity.</p>

<p>In primitive communal organization the judge
and military chief united for “mutual insurance of
domination,” drawing to their support the slavish
loyalty of the witch-doctor or priest. In the twelfth
century, however, the old communal spirit broke
forth with “striking spontaneity all over Europe;”
it stopped for a time the growth of the despotic
monarchies of Europe; it produced endless numbers
of communes.</p>

<p>The free cities developed under the shelter of
communal liberties, and in them art and invention
flourished, producing the beauty of Raphael, the
vigor of Michaelangelo, the poetry of Dante, and
“the discoveries which have been made by modern
science,—the compass, the clock, the watch, printing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
gunpowder, the maritime discoveries, the law
of gravitation.”<a id="FNanchor_XXI-4" href="#Footnote_XXI-4" class="fnanchor">XXI-4</a></p>

<p>Then, there came the modern State formed by a
triple alliance of the military chief, the Roman
judge, and the priest. The industrial revolution
and the rise of capitalism furthered the interests
of the military-legal-priestly triumvirate. When
the State and Church were separated, the money
baron took the place of the priest in the triumvirate.
With the overthrow of militarism the power of the
triumvirate is broken, and the old communal co-operative
feelings of man again begin to express
themselves. Kropotkin led the way in defining the
law of co-operative individualism. He urged decentralization
in social control, and attacked monopolies
of all types, public as well as private. Although
he exaggerated the rôle of mutual aid in
primitive society, considering it the main social
factor, he nevertheless rendered a valuable service
in giving the world a vigorous presentation of a
significant concept.</p>

<p>The social process was analyzed in terms of both
conflict and co-operation by Gustav Ratzenhofer
(1842–1904). It is characterized by a continuous
reappearance of the phenomena of individualization
of structures already extant.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-5" href="#Footnote_XXI-5" class="fnanchor">XXI-5</a> Both differentiation
and socialization arise out of the operation of human
interests. Both are implicit in the nature of
man. Certain human interests lead to individualization
and some to communitization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>At this point we encounter Ratzenhofer’s theory
of force. Force and interest are made the two
primordial principles. These two factors work together
in order to secure for the individual the
largest possible degree of self development.</p>

<p>The struggle of pre-primitive men against the
harsh phases of nature established a pre-primitive
sociality. Struggle has always led to co-operation
in the interests of preservation. Similarly, war
leads to co-operation. In primitive society institutions
arose in response to community needs.
Among barbarians the increase in numbers produced
an increasing emphasis upon conflict, which
was expressed in robberies, wars, and enslavements.
Warfare led to the formation of classes and class
conflicts. Class interests, as distinguished from individual
interests, then began to secure definition.
With the rise of capitalism, the interests of capital
were asserted; and at once the interests of labor, in
apposition, assumed tangible expression. A stage,
however, of stable social conditions is coming, in
which the whole world will be organized on the
basis of a single system of economic and non-competing
production and of free international exchange.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-6" href="#Footnote_XXI-6" class="fnanchor">XXI-6</a></p>

<p>Throughout this analysis Ratzenhofer gives force
a leading place.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-7" href="#Footnote_XXI-7" class="fnanchor">XXI-7</a> He also develops a theory of a
ruling aristocracy of supermen. Despite these unfortunate
emphases, Ratzenhofer’s contribution to
social thought in his theory of interests as dominating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
human factors, and his accent upon the rise
of an increasing degree of co-operation, is noteworthy.</p>

<p>Professor Albion Small, whose methodology will
be indicated in <a href="#Chapter_XXVII">Chapter XXVII</a>, has modified, corrected,
and refined Ratzenhofer’s theory of interests.
“In the beginning were interests,” says
Professor Small.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-8" href="#Footnote_XXI-8" class="fnanchor">XXI-8</a> An “interest” is defined as an
unsatisfied capacity, an unrealized condition of the
organism, a tendency securing satisfaction of an
unsatisfied capacity.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-9" href="#Footnote_XXI-9" class="fnanchor">XXI-9</a> In its subjective phase an interest
is a desire, and in its objective phase, a want.
An interest is developed when the individual knows
something, feels something, or wills something.
Consequently, the whole individual or social process
consists in developing, adjusting, and satisfying
interests.</p>

<p>The six groups into which Professor Small divides
all interests are as follows: (1) The health
interest arises from the sheer interest in keeping
alive. It is expressed in the food interest, the sex
interest, the work interest and includes all the
desires which find satisfaction in the exercise of the
powers of the body. (2) The wealth interest is
encompassed in the desire for mastery over things.
(3) The sociability interest is represented at its
best by the appetite for personal interchanges of
stimulus of a purely spiritual nature. (4) The
knowledge interest arises from the curiosity impulses.
The limits of its possibilities are expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
in the terms, nescience and omniscience. (5) The
beauty interest secures satisfaction through an appreciation
of the symmetrical phases of material
and spiritual phenomena. (6) The rightness interest
traverses the gamut of all other interests. It
results in enjoyment when it secures the sanction
of the individual’s ideal self or of his whole self.</p>

<p>Each of these interests tends to be absolute.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-10" href="#Footnote_XXI-10" class="fnanchor">XXI-10</a>
Each seeks satisfaction regardless of the others. In
consequence, there is a universal conflict of interests.
Moreover, there is a universal conjunction
of interests. The conflict, however, is more spectacular
than the conjunction. In the history of
mankind this conflict has been the predominating
relationship. The social process has resolved itself
into a series of reactions between persons some of
whose interests comport, but others of which conflict.
Furthermore, the social process is a continual
formation of groups and institutions around interests.
It is a perpetual equating and adjusting of
interests;<a id="FNanchor_XXI-11" href="#Footnote_XXI-11" class="fnanchor">XXI-11</a> it is a rhythm of differentiations and
integrations.</p>

<p>Professor Small points out that struggle and
co-operation are always to a certain extent functions
of each other.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-12" href="#Footnote_XXI-12" class="fnanchor">XXI-12</a> Moreover, in the social
process viewed historically, there is a movement
“from a maximum toward a minimum of conflict,
from a minimum toward a maximum of helpful
reciprocity.” The social process, thus, is a perpetual
readjustment between the forces which “tend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
backward toward more struggle, and those that
tend forward toward more socialization.” By a
minimum of conflict, Professor Small does not
mean absence of conflict, for he recognizes that
stagnation would result in a society in which conflict
was eliminated. By a maximum of co-operation
he does not refer to a state of complete social
solidification, which in turn would mean stagnation
and death.</p>

<p>The fundamental social problem is to give free
scope to those interests which require the fullest
rational development of all other interests. The
social problem is to intellectualize all the interests,
and moreover, to intellectualize the conflict of interests.
Hence the fundamental conflict today is
between the knowledge interest and all other interests.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-13" href="#Footnote_XXI-13" class="fnanchor">XXI-13</a>
Socialization, then, becomes the process
of transforming conflict into co-operation.</p>

<p>Sociology may be said to be the study of human
interests, together with their conflicts and reciprocities.
It is an interpretation of human association
in terms of the effective interests of man. It focalizes
within one field of vision all human activities
so that the persons who have the benefit of this
outlook may rate their own activities in relation to
the whole.</p>

<p>In a concrete, specific way Professor Small has
presented his theory of the social process in
the book, <i>Between Eras, From Capitalism to Democracy</i>.
Here is a vivid picture of the conflict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
between labor and capital, with the resultant misunderstandings
and injustices. A young lady,
Hector, observes the essential activities of labor
and capital, and as a representative of capital perceives
the relationship which actually exists between
herself and one of the working girls. She receives
large dividends, for which she puts nothing into the
productive activities of the corporation. The working
girl is paid low wages, but is giving her life to
the industrial concern from which Hector’s liberal
dividends are pouring forth. The main end of the
discussion is an argument for the establishment of
the principle of industrial democracy. Professor
Small urges that the employees, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>, be given
representation on boards of directors. While this
representation at first will necessarily be a minority
one, it will serve the useful purpose of providing
for regular meetings of the representatives of the
employees around the same council table. These
council meetings will enable the representatives of
either party in the bitter labor-capital conflict to
become acquainted with the problems which the
opposing group faces. In this interchange Professor
Small sees the rise of a spirit of co-operation
which will melt many of the difficulties that have
sprung up in the controversy between capital and
labor.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-14" href="#Footnote_XXI-14" class="fnanchor">XXI-14</a> Although Dr. Small’s <i>Between Eras</i> was
published in 1913, the idea of industrial representation
was not considered seriously in the United
States until about 1918. The initial steps which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
have thus far been taken toward industrial representation
in the management of business and in the
determination of wages, hours, and conditions of
labor, have produced noteworthy co-operative results
and have fully justified Professor Small’s
prophetic recommendation for the solution of a
world-disturbing social situation.</p>

<p>The primordial social group, according to Professor
E. A. Ross, is a band of mothers and their
children. In such groupings preliminary socialization
took place. In earliest societies definite principles
of human action made themselves evident.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-15" href="#Footnote_XXI-15" class="fnanchor">XXI-15</a>
Domination was one of the ruling principles. Note
for example the domination (1) by parents over
offspring, (2) by old over young, (3) by husband
over wife, (4) by men over women, (5) by the
military over the industrial classes, (6) by the
wealthy over the poor. The chief purpose in
dominating is to exploit, that is, to use other individuals
as means to one’s own ends.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-16" href="#Footnote_XXI-16" class="fnanchor">XXI-16</a></p>

<p>Socialization, or social adaptation, runs the
gamut of toleration, compromise, accommodation,
and amalgamation. The simplest form of co-operation
is mutual aid, which, however, is more popular
among the lower classes than among the higher.
Socialization, it may be noted here, has been shown
by E. W. Burgess to be the fundamental process in
the determination of social progress.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-17" href="#Footnote_XXI-17" class="fnanchor">XXI-17</a></p>

<p>Organization of effort is a specific societal
method, which has developed in society, for getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
things done. Organization results (1) in the accomplishment
of ends which are unattainable otherwise,
(2) in arousing a common interest intermittently
in all, (3) in dividing a task into its natural
parts, (4) in securing a degree of expertness, (5)
in producing a co-ordinated, intelligent plan, (6) in
eliminating needless duplication of effort.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-18" href="#Footnote_XXI-18" class="fnanchor">XXI-18</a> On the
other hand, organization leads to wastes and
abuses, which are: (1) overhead expenses; (2)
undue time devoted to making out reports and similar
routine work; (3) a loss in personal contacts;
(4) a tendency to formalism and red tape; (5) an
inflexibility of machinery; (6) a misapplication of
power to personal ends; (7) too much specialization;
(8) the organization becomes an end in itself.</p>

<p>Socialization, in content, is the development of a
we-feeling in a number of persons, and “their
growth in capacity and will to act together.”<a id="FNanchor_XXI-19" href="#Footnote_XXI-19" class="fnanchor">XXI-19</a> A
very simple causal factor of this process is the age-long
custom of giving a banquet, that is, in eating
and drinking together. A consciousness of kind
arises which, as Professor Ross believes, is not the
perception of a general resemblance but “an awareness
of likeness or agreement in specific matters.”<a id="FNanchor_XXI-20" href="#Footnote_XXI-20" class="fnanchor">XXI-20</a>
Nationalism, or the process of creating a spirit of
national patriotism, illustrates the meaning of the
socialization concept.</p>

<p>The sociology of L. T. Hobhouse, discussed in
part in <a href="#Chapter_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>, is largely an interpretation
of society in terms of increasing co-operation. Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Hobhouse has defined social progress as the
development of the principle of union, order, co-operation,
and harmony among individuals. He has
described a certain mutual interest, similar to Giddings’
consciousness of kind, which has served to
keep individuals together, from the lowest groups
of savages to the highest civilized groups.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-21" href="#Footnote_XXI-21" class="fnanchor">XXI-21</a></p>

<p>The social process, as Professor Cooley analyzes
it, is not a series of futile repetitions or brutal and
wasteful conflicts, but an eternal, onward growth
which produces increasingly humane, rational, and
co-operative beings. While the element of conflict
is useful in that it awakens and directs human attention
and thus leads to activity, it is limited by
a superintending factor of co-operation and organization
to which the contestants must adjust themselves
if they would succeed.<a id="FNanchor_XXI-22" href="#Footnote_XXI-22" class="fnanchor">XXI-22</a></p>

<p>The discussions in this and the preceding chapter
have shown that the natural trend of evolution is
away from a pitiless competitive and destructive
social process, and toward a tempered, productive,
and co-operative process. Of course, there are reactionary
movements from time to time which halt
the co-operative trend. On the other hand, the development
of reason gradually eliminates the more
brutal effects of conflict. Conflict, however, will
always remain, as far as can now be seen, an essential
factor in the processes of individual and societal
growth. Through rational controls, it will operate
in the direction and interest of the co-operative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
spirit. In the old social order, hate and the spirit
of conflict have ruled. The spirit of co-operation
has often been utilized only for selfish purposes. In
the coming social order love and the co-operative
spirit will direct, while the spirit of conflict will play
a vital but secondary rôle.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Psycho-Sociologic Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>A large number of references have already been
made to psycho-sociologic thought. In origin it
may be traced to the primitive days of the race.
The folkways reveal keen psycho-sociologic observations.
Undoubtedly, many phases of the psychic
nature of group activities were known to the leaders
of ancient civilizations. Plato wrote on the importance
of custom and custom imitation as a societal
force. Aristotle understood the socio-psychic
nature of man when he observed that property
which is owned in common is least taken care of,
and when he declared that a fundamental test of
good government may be found in the attitude of
a people toward public service. In his theory of
social attitudes Aristotle made a distinct contribution
to psycho-sociologic thought.</p>

<p>Thomas More analyzed the causes of human actions.
He was a worthy social psychologist when
he protested against heaping punishment upon
human beings, without attempting to understand
the causes of criminal conduct and without seeking
to remove the societal causes of such conduct.
Bodin postulated a theory of interests in his explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
of social evolution. He made the common
economic, religious, and other interests of man
the basis of social organization. These interests,
according to Bodin, led primitive families to form
a commonality of organization or government.</p>

<p>It was Hobbes who believed that man originally
was a being of entirely selfish interests. Man’s
interest in others was based on their ability to cater
to his own good. This theory still has strong support;
there are large numbers of individuals who
today apparently are living according to this rule.
Nations oftentimes still seem to be motivated by no
higher principle. On the basis of an introspective
psychology, Hobbes made the scientific observation
that “he that is going to be a whole man must read
in himself—mankind.” Such a person must not
simply find in himself this or that man’s interests,
but the interests of all mankind.</p>

<p>George Berkeley (1685–1753), bishop of Cloyne
and eminent philosopher, in his <i>Principles of Moral
Attraction</i> attempted to point out the analogies between
the physical and social universe. His work
was stimulated by the discoveries of Isaac Newton.
He tried to apply the Newtonian formulas to society.
While his “physical analogies” are of little
value, they represent a stage in the rise of psycho-sociologic
thought. He made the social instinct, or
the gregarious instinct, in society the analogue of
the force of gravitation. The centrifugal force in
society is selfishness; and the centripetal, sociability.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
As the attractive force of one mass for another
varies directly in relation to the distance between
them, so the attraction of individuals for one another
varies directly in proportion to their resemblances.
The physical analogies, however, could
not be carried far without being lost in the realm
of absurdity.</p>

<p>The Scotch philosopher, David Hume, has been
called the father of social psychology because of his
splendid analysis of sympathy as a social force.
“Let all the powers and elements of nature conspire
to serve and obey one man, ... he will still be miserable,
till you give him some one person at least with
whom he may share his happiness, and whose esteem
and friendship he may enjoy.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-1" href="#Footnote_XXII-1" class="fnanchor">XXII-1</a> “Whatever
other passions we may be actuated by, pride, ambition,
avarice, curiosity, revenge or lust,—the soul or
animating principle of them is sympathy.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-2" href="#Footnote_XXII-2" class="fnanchor">XXII-2</a></p>

<p>But sympathy is not always limited in its operation
to the present moment. Through sympathy we
may put ourselves in the future situation of any
person whose present condition arouses our interest
in him. Moreover, if we see a stranger in danger,
we will run to his assistance.</p>

<p>Vice was defined by Hume as everything which
gives uneasiness in human actions. By sympathy,
we become uneasy when we become aware of injustice
anywhere. “Self-interest is the original
motive to the establishment of justice; but a sympathy
with public interest is the source of the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
approbation which attends that virtue.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-3" href="#Footnote_XXII-3" class="fnanchor">XXII-3</a> There is
a continual conflict between self-interest and sympathy,
both in the individual and between individuals
in society. Although at times this self-interest
seems to predominate, “it does not entirely
abolish the more generous and noble intercourse of
friendship and good offices.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-4" href="#Footnote_XXII-4" class="fnanchor">XXII-4</a></p>

<p>Sympathy causes people to be interested in the
good of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-5" href="#Footnote_XXII-5" class="fnanchor">XXII-5</a> But whatever human factor is
contiguous either in space or time has a proportional
effect on the will, passions, and imagination.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-6" href="#Footnote_XXII-6" class="fnanchor">XXII-6</a>
It commonly operates with greater force than any
human factor that lies in a distant and more obscure
light. This principle explains why people often act
in contradiction to their interests, and “why they
prefer any trivial advantage that is present to the
maintenance of order in society.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the analysis of sympathy by
Hume, Adam Smith made sympathy a leading concept
in his theory of political economy. Smith also
carried the concept of self-interest, with the resultant
conflict between self-interest and social interest,
into nearly all his economic theories.</p>

<p>According to Adam Smith there are four classes
of people in modern life. (1) There are those who
live by taking rent. They have social interests but
are not socially productive; they grow listless and
careless. (2) There is the class which takes wages.
This group is large, productive, and socially interested,
but their widespread lack of education makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
them subject to the passions of the day, and hence
socially useless or even harmful. (3) Those who
take profit have interests at direct variance with the
welfare of society. Their selfish interests become
unduly developed; their public attitudes are usually
dangerous to all except themselves. (4) The
fourth group is composed of all who derive a living
from serving one or more of the three afore-mentioned
classes. The interests of the three first-mentioned
groups often clash, leading to destructive
social conflicts. Despite this conclusion, Adam
Smith was an advocate of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez faire</i>. He urged
that natural laws be allowed to express themselves
normally.</p>

<p>In 1859, Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal
began to contribute to social thought in the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Zeitschrift
für Völker-Psychologie und Sprachwissenschaft</i>.
They applied psychological methods to the
study of primitive society. In this journal they made
notable contributions concerning the social customs
and mental traits of early mankind. It is in this
field, which was discussed in <a href="#Chapter_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>, that
the original work of such men as Franz Boas, W.
G. Sumner, W. I. Thomas, and L. T. Hobhouse belongs.
Fundamental pioneering in psycho-sociologic
thought was done by Lester F. Ward (see
<a href="#Chapter_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>). Ward opposed the prevailing belief
of his time, and particularly of Herbert Spencer,
that society must continue as it now is going
on, namely, an exhibition of a blind struggle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
competitive forces. He not only perceived the rise
of mind out of the obscure processes of social evolution,
but more important still, he noted the part
that mind may play in modifying the course of
social forces. Although he considered the human
desires to be the dynamic social elements, he gave
to mind, through its power of prevision, the prerogative
of directing the desires of mankind.
Moreover, he pointed out the direction in which
mind could best guide the desires. He urged a
sociocracy in which the desires of the individual
are so controlled that they operate only when in
harmony with the welfare of other individuals.
For establishing these fundamental considerations,
Ward ranks high in the history of psycho-sociologic
thought.</p>

<p>The chief founder of social psychology was
Gabriel Tarde (1843–1904). He wrote the first important
treatise in the field of the psychology of society.
The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lois de l’imitation</i> established Tarde’s
reputation as a social psychologist, and at the same
time aroused the world of thought to the existence
of a new phase of social science. Tarde was a jurist
who inquired into the causes of anti-social conduct.
He was greatly impressed by the observation that
criminal acts are committed in waves. Upon examination
of this fact he found imitation to be a
potent factor, and began to analyze the laws of imitation.
This study soon showed that not all is
imitation but that much human conduct arises out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
of opposition. His analysis of the laws of opposition
led him to the conclusion that imitation and
opposition are the bases of a third social factor, invention.
The social process, as he observed it, is
characterized (1) by an ever-widening imitation of
inventions, (2) by the opposition of conflicting circles
of imitation, and (3) by the rise of new inventions
(out of these oppositions), which in turn become
the centers of new imitations. Thus, the
social process goes on, endlessly and unconsciously
or consciously. To understand society, Tarde believed
that one must understand how minds act and
interact.</p>

<p>Tarde’s work, first presented is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Lois de l’imitation</i>,
was formally developed in his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Logique
sociale</i>, and summarized in his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lois sociale</i> (English
translation, <i>Social Laws</i>). Together, these books
constitute a unique social theory. Although Tarde’s
approach to the psychology of society was objective
and sociological, and although he did not give serious
attention to the purely psychological nature of
the mind nor to the instinctive bases of conduct,
he nevertheless made a contribution to social
thought which is valid and enlightening.</p>

<p>Society, according to Tarde, is a group of people
“who display many resemblances, produced either
by imitation or by counter-imitation.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-7" href="#Footnote_XXII-7" class="fnanchor">XXII-7</a> Again, he
says that society is “a group of distinct individuals
who render one another mutual services.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-8" href="#Footnote_XXII-8" class="fnanchor">XXII-8</a> Societies
are groups of people who are organized because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
of agreement or disagreement of beliefs.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-9" href="#Footnote_XXII-9" class="fnanchor">XXII-9</a> “Society
is imitation.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-10" href="#Footnote_XXII-10" class="fnanchor">XXII-10</a> The outstanding element in social
life is a psychological process in which inventions
are followed by imitations, which when coming into
inevitable oppositions produce new inventions.</p>

<p>To the degree that a person is social he is imitative.
In the way that vital, or biological, resemblances
are due to heredity, so human resemblances
are caused by imitation. The closer the human resemblances
between individuals, even though they
be occupational competitors, the larger will be the
proportion of imitations and the closer the social
relationships. The father will always be the son’s
first model.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-11" href="#Footnote_XXII-11" class="fnanchor">XXII-11</a> A beloved ruler will so fascinate his
people that they will imitate blindly, yea, even be
thrown into a state of catalepsy by him. In such
a case imitation becomes a kind of somnambulism.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-12" href="#Footnote_XXII-12" class="fnanchor">XXII-12</a></p>

<p>Imitations are characterized by inclines, plateaus,
and declines.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-13" href="#Footnote_XXII-13" class="fnanchor">XXII-13</a> The incline refers to the period of
time which an imitation requires for adoption. The
plateau is the length of time during which an imitation
is in force. The decline, of course, has to do
with the passing away of an imitation. Each of
these phases are of varying lengths—dependent
upon the operation of almost countless socio-psychical
factors. It is this career through which all
imitations must pass that is the important phase of
history.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-14" href="#Footnote_XXII-14" class="fnanchor">XXII-14</a></p>

<p>There are two causal factors determining the nature
of imitation: logical, and non-logical.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-15" href="#Footnote_XXII-15" class="fnanchor">XXII-15</a> Logical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
causes operate when the imitator adopts an innovation
that is in line with the principles that have
already found a place in his own mind. Extra-logical,
or non-logical, imitations are those which
are determined by the adventitious factors of place,
date, or birth of the individual.</p>

<p>The fundamental law of imitation, stated in simplest
terms, is that the superior are imitated by the
inferior, for example: the patrician by the plebeian;
the nobleman by the commoner; the beloved by the
lover.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-16" href="#Footnote_XXII-16" class="fnanchor">XXII-16</a> A more accurate statement of the law of
imitation is that “the thing that is most imitated is
the most superior one of those that are nearest.”
The term “superior” in all these cases must be used
in the subjective sense, that is to say, that which
seems to the specific individual to be superior, not
necessarily that which actually is the superior, is
imitated.</p>

<p>A country or period of time is democratic if the
distance between the highest and lowest classes is
lessened enough so that the highest may be imitated
freely by the lowest.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-17" href="#Footnote_XXII-17" class="fnanchor">XXII-17</a> Democracy will keep the
distance between classes reduced to that minimum
where imitation may operate.</p>

<p>An important phase of sociology involves the
knowledge and control of imitations.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-18" href="#Footnote_XXII-18" class="fnanchor">XXII-18</a> Sociological
statistics should determine (1) “the imitative
power which inheres in every invention at any given
time and place;” and (2) “the beneficial or harmful
effects which result from the imitation of given inventions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p>Imitation
is divided into sets of complementary
tendencies; custom imitation and fashion imitation;
sympathy imitation and obedience imitation; naïve
imitation and deliberate imitation.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-19" href="#Footnote_XXII-19" class="fnanchor">XXII-19</a> Everywhere
custom imitation and fashion imitation are embodied
in two parties, divisions, or organizations—the
conservative and the liberal.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-20" href="#Footnote_XXII-20" class="fnanchor">XXII-20</a></p>

<p>Through custom imitation, usages acquire autocratic
power. They control habit, regulate private
conduct, and define morals and manners with imperial
authority. Usages are frequently extra-logical
imitations. Usages are commonly accepted first
by the upper classes. They usually are related primarily
to objects of luxury; they stick tenaciously
to the leisure-time phases of life. Their most favorable
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i> is a social and individual status of ignorance.</p>

<p>Fashion imitation rules by epochs, for example:
Athens under Solon, Rome under the Scipios, Florence
in the fifteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-21" href="#Footnote_XXII-21" class="fnanchor">XXII-21</a> These epochs of
fashion produce great individualities—illustrious
legislators, and founders of empire. Whenever the
currents of fashions are set free, the inventive
imagination is excited and ambitions are stimulated.</p>

<p>Fashion imitation has a democratizing influence.
A prolonged process of fashion imitation ends “by
putting pupil-peoples upon the same level, both in
their armaments and in their arts and sciences, with
their master people.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-22" href="#Footnote_XXII-22" class="fnanchor">XXII-22</a> In fact, the very desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
be like the superior is a latent democratizing force.</p>

<p>The counterpart of imitation is opposition. Opposition,
however, may be a very special kind of
repetition. There are two types of opposition:
interference-combinations and interference-conflicts.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-23" href="#Footnote_XXII-23" class="fnanchor">XXII-23</a>
The first type refers to the coming together
of two psychological quantities of desire and belief
with the result that combination takes place and a
total gain is made. The second type refers to the
opposition resulting from incompatible forces. In
this case an individual or social loss is registered.</p>

<p>From another standpoint, opposition appears in
one of three forms, namely, war, competition, and
discussion.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-24" href="#Footnote_XXII-24" class="fnanchor">XXII-24</a> Conflicts often pass through these
three forms, which are obedient to the same law of
development, but in order are characterized by ever-widening
areas of pacification, alternating however
with renewals of discord. As war is the lowest,
most brutal form of conflict, discussion is the highest,
most rational form.</p>

<p>Opposition in human life is society’s logical
duel.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-25" href="#Footnote_XXII-25" class="fnanchor">XXII-25</a> This duel sometimes ends abruptly when
one of the adversaries is summarily suppressed by
force. Sometimes a resort to arms brings a military
victory. Sometimes a new invention or discovery
expels one of the adversaries from the social
scene.</p>

<p>The logical result of opposition is invention or
adaptation. “Invention is a question followed by
an answer.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-26" href="#Footnote_XXII-26" class="fnanchor">XXII-26</a> Invention, or adaptation, at its best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
is “the felicitous interference of two imitations,
occurring first in one single mind.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-27" href="#Footnote_XXII-27" class="fnanchor">XXII-27</a> Inventions
grow in two ways: (1) in extension—by imitative
diffusion; and (2) in comprehension—by a series
of logical combinations, such as the combination of
the wheel and the horse in the inventions of the
horse-cart.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-28" href="#Footnote_XXII-28" class="fnanchor">XXII-28</a></p>

<p>Inventions partially determine the nature of new
inventions and new discoveries. A new invention
makes possible other inventions, and so on. Each
invention is the possible parent of a thousand offspring
inventions.</p>

<p>To be inventive, one must be wide-awake, inquiring,
incredulous, not docile and dreamy, or living in
a social sleep. The inventor is one who escapes, for
the time being, from his social surroundings.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-29" href="#Footnote_XXII-29" class="fnanchor">XXII-29</a> Inventing
develops from wanting. A man experiences
some want, and in order to satisfy this want he invents.
Inventiveness is contrary in nature to sheepishness.</p>

<p>Since an invention is the answer to a problem,
inventions are the real objective factors which mark
the stage of progress. But invention, according to
Tarde, becomes increasingly difficult. Problems
naturally grow increasingly complex as the simpler
ones are mastered. Unfortunately, the mind of
man is not capable of indefinite development, and
therefore will reach a limit in solving problems.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-30" href="#Footnote_XXII-30" class="fnanchor">XXII-30</a>
At this point, Tarde is on doubtful ground. His
argument can neither be proved nor disproved. Apparently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
man’s ability to solve problems increases
with his training and experience in that connection.
Moreover, man appears to be at the very dawn of
his possibilities in the field of invention. He is only
beginning to gather together systematically the materials
for inventing, and to understand slightly the
principles of inventing.</p>

<p>Inventors are imitative.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-31" href="#Footnote_XXII-31" class="fnanchor">XXII-31</a> This statement is but
another way of saying that inventions are cumulative,
that they come in droves, that they are gregarious.
A new discovery will arouse the ambition
of many wide-awake persons to make similar discoveries.
“There is in every period a current of inventions
which is in a certain general sense religious
or architectural or sculptural or musical or
philosophical.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-32" href="#Footnote_XXII-32" class="fnanchor">XXII-32</a></p>

<p>Invention and imitation represent the chief
forces in society.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-33" href="#Footnote_XXII-33" class="fnanchor">XXII-33</a> Invention is “intermittent, rare,
and eruptive only at certain infrequent intervals.”
It explains “the source of privileges, monopolies,
and aristocratic inequalities.” Imitation, on the
other hand, is democratic, leveling, and “incessant
like the stream deposition of the Nile or Euphrates.”
At times the eruptions of invention take place
faster than they can be imitated. At other times
imitations flow in a monotonous circular current.</p>

<p>The contributions of Tarde to social thought
have stimulated numerous investigators to enter the
field of social psychology. While Tarde’s thinking
has been severely criticised by the psychologists and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
modified by the sociologists, it has opened mines
of valuable social ores. Not the least important
consideration was the impetus which the Tardian
thought gave to American writers, such as E. A.
Ross.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-34" href="#Footnote_XXII-34" class="fnanchor">XXII-34</a> Tarde’s name, however, will be long revered
for the penetrating way in which he developed the
concept of imitation. Although Walter Bagehot,
an English publicist, in an epoch-stirring book,
<i>Physics and Politics</i>, published an important chapter
on “Imitation” as early as 1872, it was Tarde’s
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lois de l’imitation</i> in 1890 which at once became
the authority on the subject. In the United States,
Michael M. Davis, Jr., has written an excellent
summary of Tarde’s socio-psychologic thought.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-35" href="#Footnote_XXII-35" class="fnanchor">XXII-35</a>
As a critical digest of Tardian thought, Dr. Davis’
<i>Psychological Interpretations of Society</i> is unsurpassed.</p>

<p>In 1892, Profesor H. Schmidkunz published an
elaborate work on the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Psychologie der Suggestion</i>.
This book is an important pioneer work. In the
English language, the writings of Boris Sidis on
the psychology of suggestion are well-known. Professor
E. A. Ross has given an intensive treatment
of the theme in his <i>Social Psychology</i>. In these
various discussions, however, the fact is not made
clear that suggestion and imitation are correlative
phases of the same phenomenon. The point, also,
is not developed that suggestion-imitation phenomena
are natural products of social situations in
which like stimuli normally produce like responses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p>In 1895, the first book by Gustave Le Bon on
crowd psychology was published. Le Bon has also
written on the psychology of revolutions, of war,
and of peoples. He gave a limited definition to the
term, crowds, and then applied the term to nearly
all types of group life. He conceived of crowds as
“feeling phenomena.” They are more or less pathological.
Since the proletariat are subject to crowd
psychology, they are untrustworthy and to be rewarded
perpetually with suspicion. A sounder,
more synthetic, and historical position concerning
the psychology of groups and of society is taken
by G. L. Duprat in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Psychologie sociale</i>.</p>

<p>Italian contributions in the field of crowd and
group psychology are represented by Paolo Orano’s
<i>Psicologia sociale</i>, which includes only a partial
treatment of the subject that is indicated by the
title; and by Scipio Sighele’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La foule criminelle</i>
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Psychologie des sectes</i>. Permanent groups, according
to Sighele (following Tarde), are either
sects, castes, classes, or states.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-36" href="#Footnote_XXII-36" class="fnanchor">XXII-36</a> The sect is a group
of individuals which possesses a common ideal and
faith, such as a religious denomination or a political
party. The caste arises from identity of profession.
The class is characterized by a strong unity of interests.
States possess common bonds of language,
national values, and national prestige.</p>

<p>The concept of “consciousness of kind” was developed
by Franklin H. Giddings in his <i>Principles
of Sociology</i> (1896). Consciousness of kind is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
original and elementary subjective fact in society.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-37" href="#Footnote_XXII-37" class="fnanchor">XXII-37</a>
Professor Giddings defines this term to mean “a
state of consciousness in which any being, whether
low or high in the scale of life, recognizes another
conscious being as of like kind with itself.” In its
widest meaning, consciousness of kind marks the
difference between the animate and the inanimate.
Among human beings it distinguishes “social conduct”
from purely economic or purely religious
activity. Around consciousness of kind, as a determining
principle, all other human motives organize
themselves.</p>

<p>People group together according to the development
of the consciousness of kind in them. Roughly
speaking, there are four such groupings.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-38" href="#Footnote_XXII-38" class="fnanchor">XXII-38</a> (1)
The non-social are persons in whom the consciousness
of kind has not yet developed—in whom it
finds imperfect but not degenerate expression, and
from whom the other classes arise. (2) The anti-social,
or criminal, classes include those persons in
whom the consciousness of kind is approaching extinction.
They detest society. (3) The pseudo-social,
or pauper, classes are characterized by a degeneration
of the genuine consciousness of kind.
(4) The social classes are noted for a high development
of the consciousness of kind; they constitute
the positive and constructive elements in society.
At the head of the list are the pre-eminently social.
These people devote their lives and means to the
amelioration of society; they are called the natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
aristocracy of the race, the true social élite.</p>

<p>Consciousness of kind is made possible in part by
the operation of physical factors. Fertility of soil
is one of the sources of human aggregation. Favorable
climate makes aggregation possible. Aggregation
of population is either genetic (due to the
birth rate) or congregate (due to immigration).
Aggregation leads to association—the proper <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">milieu</i>
for the growth of consciousness of kind.</p>

<p>Aggregation guarantees social intercourse, which
is a mode of conflict. Conflict, according to Professor
Giddings, becomes the basis of social growth.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-39" href="#Footnote_XXII-39" class="fnanchor">XXII-39</a>
Primary conflicts are those in which one adversary
is completely outdone, and hence likely to be
crushed, by the other. Secondary conflict refers to
the contests between more or less evenly balanced
forces. Primary conflict is conquest; secondary
conflict is growth. Among people secondary conflict
leads to the development of consciousness of
kind through the successive steps of communication,
imitation, toleration, co-operation, alliance.
The supreme result is the production of pre-eminently
social classes. Of these various factors,
Professor Giddings particularly stresses imitation.
“It is the factor of imitation in the conflict that
gradually assimilates and harmonizes.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-40" href="#Footnote_XXII-40" class="fnanchor">XXII-40</a></p>

<p>Association reacts upon individuals and produces
self-consciousness, which in turn creates social self-consciousness,
or group awareness of itself. Social
self-consciousness is characterized by rational discussion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
With the rise of discussion, social memory,
or traditions, becomes possible. Moreover, a sense
of social values arises. Public opinion springs from
the passing of judgment by the members of the
group upon any matters of general interest.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-41" href="#Footnote_XXII-41" class="fnanchor">XXII-41</a></p>

<p>Social memory, or traditions, becomes highly
differentiated.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-42" href="#Footnote_XXII-42" class="fnanchor">XXII-42</a> It consists of impressions concerning
the tangible world, the intangible world, and the
conceptional world. The traditions in any field, plus
current opinion in that field, form the standards,
ideals, faiths, “isms” of the time. For example,
the integration of economic traditions with current
economic opinions is the general standard of living
of the time and place. The integration of the
aesthetic tradition with current criticism is taste,
and the modification of a traditional religious belief
by current religious ideas is a faith.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as consciousness of kind is the psychological
basis of social phenomena, it is natural
that the chief social value is the kind itself, or the
type of conscious life that is characteristic of the
society.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-43" href="#Footnote_XXII-43" class="fnanchor">XXII-43</a> The social cohesion is another important
social value. Social cohesion is vital to the unity of
any group; therefore the group is usually willing
to make many sacrifices in its own behalf. The
distinctive possessions and properties of the community,
such as territory, sacred or historic places,
heroes, ceremonies, constitute the third class of
social values. A fourth group is found in the general
principles which promote the growth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
group; for example, the principles of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. The social values largely determine
the social choices of groups and the nature of
social organizations.</p>

<p>Professor Giddings develops an interesting theory
of the dualism in social structures. Civilization
is marked by the contemporaneous existence of
public and private associations. Civilized society
affords four main sets of dualistic associations:
political, juristic, economic, and cultural. In the
political field there are private political parties and
the public association, namely, the government, or
the political party in power. Among juristic associations
there are the privately-organized vigilance
committees and the public associations, such as the
police, the courts, the prisons. In the realm of
economics there are private individual entrepreneurs,
partnerships, corporations; and on the other
hand, there are the governmentally-owned railroads,
postal service, the water systems, the coinage
systems. In regard to cultural associations we may
note the privately endowed universities and state
universities, privately organized churches and state
churches, private charities and public charities.
This dualism in social structure is supported by
Professor Giddings on the grounds that private
associations are needed for purposes of initiation,
experimentation, and stimulation; and the public
associations serve the useful purposes of regulation
and maintenance of balance among various contending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
factors.</p>

<p>The highest test of social organization is the
development of social personality. An efficient
social organization is one which makes its members
“more rational, more sympathetic, with an
ever-broadening consciousness of kind.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-44" href="#Footnote_XXII-44" class="fnanchor">XXII-44</a></p>

<p>In recent works Professor Giddings has developed
the concept of pluralistic behavior. “Any one
or any combination of behavior inciting stimuli may
on occasion be reacted to by more than one individual.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-45" href="#Footnote_XXII-45" class="fnanchor">XXII-45</a>
The character of pluralistic reactions,
whether similar or dissimilar, simultaneous or not,
equal or unequal, is determined by two variables:
(1) the strength of the stimulation; (2) the similarity
or dissimilarity of the reacting mechanisms.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-46" href="#Footnote_XXII-46" class="fnanchor">XXII-46</a>
Thus Professor Giddings considers pluralistic behavior
the subject matter of the psychology of
society, or sociology.</p>

<p>In 1897, <i>Social and Ethical Interpretations</i>, by
J. Mark Baldwin, was printed; it bears the subtitle
of “A Study in Social Psychology.” This was
the first time that the term, social psychology, had
appeared in the title of a book in America, though
three years earlier, in 1894, one of the leading parts
of Small and Vincent’s <i>Introduction to the Study
of Society</i> was designated “social psychology” and
included a discussion of social consciousness, social
intelligence, and social volition. Baldwin’s <i>Social
and Ethical Interpretations</i> and Giddings’ <i>Principles
of Sociology</i> appeared almost simultaneously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
one by a psychologist and the other by a sociologist.
One was written from the genetic viewpoint, and
the other from the objective viewpoint; one dealt
primarily with social psychology, and the other with
a psychology of society; one was built around the
concept of the social self, and the other around the
concept of a consciousness of kind. They both
hastened the development of an organic social psychology.</p>

<p>Professor Baldwin demonstrated that the self is
largely a product of the give-and-take of social life.
A child becomes aware of his self by setting himself
off from other selves. It is in group life, that
is, in contact with other selves, that the child develops
a self consciousness.</p>

<p>Moreover, the self is bi-polar. One end of the
self-pole is characterized by what one thinks of
himself, and the other end by what he thinks of
other persons.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-47" href="#Footnote_XXII-47" class="fnanchor">XXII-47</a> “The ego and the alter are to our
thought one and the same thing.”<a id="FNanchor_XXII-48" href="#Footnote_XXII-48" class="fnanchor">XXII-48</a></p>

<p>People are so much alike because they are imitative.
It is imitation which keeps people alike. Imitation
integrates individuals. Imitation is either
(1) a process whereby one individual consciously
or unconsciously copies another individual, or (2)
the copying of a model, that is, adopting a model
which arises in one’s own mind.<a id="FNanchor_XXII-49" href="#Footnote_XXII-49" class="fnanchor">XXII-49</a></p>

<p>Baldwin found the law of social growth in the
particularization by the individual of society’s store
of material, and by the generalization on the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
of society of the individual’s particularizations.
The essence of the first phase of this process is
invention and of the second, imitation. Baldwin
considered invention and imitation the two fundamental
processes of social growth.</p>

<p>In this chapter the strength of the psychological
approach to an understanding of societary processes
has been demonstrated. In the chapter which follows
the reader will find further materials, showing
the tremendous vitality of psycho-sociologic
thought.</p>

(continued)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In 1902, <i>Human Nature and the Social Order</i>
by Professor Charles H. Cooley was published.
This book was at once accepted as an authority on
the integral relationship of the individual self and
the social process. It was followed in 1909 by
<i>Social Organization</i>, and in 1918 by <i>Social Process</i>.
The three books constitute a chronological development
of a logical system of psycho-sociologic
thought.</p>

<p>The first volume treats of the self in its reactions
to group life; the second explains the nature
of primary groups, such as the family, playground,
and neighborhood, of the democratic mind, and of
social classes; the third analyzes the many elements
in the processes by which society is characterized.
The chief thesis of the three volumes is that the individual
and society are aspects of the same phenomenon,
and that the individual and society are
twin-born and twin-developed.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-1" href="#Footnote_XXIII-1" class="fnanchor">XXIII-1</a></p>

<p>An individual has no separate existence.
Through the hereditary and social elements in his
life he is inseparately bound up with society.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-2" href="#Footnote_XXIII-2" class="fnanchor">XXIII-2</a> He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
cannot be considered apart from individuals. Even
the phenomena which are called individualistic “are
always socialistic in the sense that they are expressive
of tendencies growing out of the general
life.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-3" href="#Footnote_XXIII-3" class="fnanchor">XXIII-3</a> It is not only true that individuals make
society, but equally true that society makes individuals.</p>

<p>Professor Cooley has given an excellent presentation
of what he calls the looking-glass self.
There are three distinct psychic elements in this
phenomenon: (1) the imagination of one’s appearance
to another person; (2) the imagined estimation
of that appearance by the other person; and
(3) a sense of pride or chagrin that is felt by the
first person. The looking-glass self affects the daily
life of all individuals. “We are ashamed to seem
evasive in the presence of a straightforward man,
cowardly in the presence of a brave one, gross in
the eyes of a refined one, and so on.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-4" href="#Footnote_XXIII-4" class="fnanchor">XXIII-4</a> Even a person’s
consciousness of himself is largely a direct reflection
of the opinions and estimates which he believes
that others hold of him.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-5" href="#Footnote_XXIII-5" class="fnanchor">XXIII-5</a></p>

<p>Professor Cooley makes a lucid distinction between
self consciousness, social consciousness, and
public consciousness. The first is what I think of
myself; the second, what I think of other people;
and the third, a collective view of the self and the
social consciousness of all the members of a group
organized and integrated into a communicating
group.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-6" href="#Footnote_XXIII-6" class="fnanchor">XXIII-6</a> Moreover, all three types of consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
are parts of an organic whole. Even the moral life
of individuals is a part of the organic unity of
society. Social knowledge is the basis of morality.
An upward endeavor is the essence of moral
progress.</p>

<p>The three groups which Professor Cooley has
called primary are so labeled because through
them the individual gets “his earliest and completest
experience of social unity.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-7" href="#Footnote_XXIII-7" class="fnanchor">XXIII-7</a> The family,
play groups, and neighborhoods remain throughout
life as the experience bases from which the
more complex phases of life receive their interpretation.</p>

<p>An unbounded faith in human nature is enjoyed
by Professor Cooley. Human nature comprises
those sentiments and impulses which are distinctly
superior to those of the higher animals, such as
sympathy, love, resentment, ambition, the feeling of
right and wrong.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-8" href="#Footnote_XXIII-8" class="fnanchor">XXIII-8</a> The improvement of society,
according to Professor Cooley, does not involve any
essential change in human nature but rather “a
larger and higher application of its familiar impulses.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-9" href="#Footnote_XXIII-9" class="fnanchor">XXIII-9</a></p>

<p>Communication is a fundamental concept in Professor
Cooley’s system of social thought. Communication
is “the mechanism through which human
relations exist and develop.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-10" href="#Footnote_XXIII-10" class="fnanchor">XXIII-10</a> Professor Cooley
has pointed out that not only does language constitute
the symbols of the mind, but that in a sense all
objects and actions are mental symbols. Communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
is the means whereby the mind develops a
true human nature. The symbols of our social
environment “supply the stimulus and framework
for all our growth.” Thus the communication concept
furnishes a substantial basis for understanding
the psycho-sociologic phenomena which are ordinarily
called suggestion and imitation.</p>

<p>Personality has its origin partly in heredity and
partly “in the stream of communication, both of
which flow from the corporate life of the race.”
A study of communication shows that the individual
mind is not a separate growth, but an integral
development of the general mind.</p>

<p>The means of communication developed remarkably
in the nineteenth century, chiefly in the following
ways: (1) in expressiveness, that is, in the
range of ideas and feelings they are competent to
carry; (2) in the permanence in recording; (3) in
swiftness of communication; and (4) in diffusion
to all classes of people.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-12" href="#Footnote_XXIII-12" class="fnanchor">XXIII-12</a> Thus society can be organized
on the bases of intelligence and of rationalized
and systematized feelings rather than on authority,
autocracy, and caste.</p>

<p>A free intercourse of ideas, that is, free and unimpeded
communication, will not produce uniformity.
Self feeling will find enlarged opportunities
for expression. An increased degree of communication
furnishes the bases for making the individual
conscious of the unique part he can and should play
in improving the quality of the social whole. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
the other hand, freedom of communication is tending
to produce “the disease of the century,” namely,
the disease of excess, of overwork, of prolonged
worry, of a competitive race for which men are not
fully equipped.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-13" href="#Footnote_XXIII-13" class="fnanchor">XXIII-13</a></p>

<p>Public opinion, according to Professor Cooley, is
not merely an aggregate of opinions of individuals,
but “a co-operative product of communication and
reciprocal influence.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-14" href="#Footnote_XXIII-14" class="fnanchor">XXIII-14</a> It is a crystalization of
diverse opinion, resulting in a certain stability of
thought. It is produced by discussion. Public
opinion is usually superior, in the sense of being
more effective, than the average opinion of the
members of the public.</p>

<p>The masses make fundamental contributions to
public opinion, not through formulated ideas but
through their sentiments. The masses in their
daily experiences are close to the salient facts of
human nature. They are not troubled with that
preoccupation with ideas which hinders them from
immediate fellowship. Neither are they limited by
that attention to the hoarding of private property
which prevents the wealthy from keeping in touch
with the common things of life.</p>

<p>The striking result of the social process is the
development of personalities. The social process
affords opportunities which individuals, ambitious
and properly stimulated, may accept. Education
may perform a useful function in adjusting individuals
to opportunities. But education often fails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
because it requires too much and inspires too little;
it accents formal knowledge at the expense of
kindling the spirit.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-15" href="#Footnote_XXIII-15" class="fnanchor">XXIII-15</a></p>

<p>Social stratification hinders.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-16" href="#Footnote_XXIII-16" class="fnanchor">XXIII-16</a> It cuts off communication.
It throws social ascendancy into the
hands of a stable, communicating minority. The
majority are submerged in the morass of ignorance.
Degrading neighborhood associations, vicious parents,
despised racial connections—these all serve to
produce stratification and to hinder progress.</p>

<p>Professor Cooley holds that in the social process
the institutional element is as essential as the personal.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-17" href="#Footnote_XXIII-17" class="fnanchor">XXIII-17</a>
Institutions bequeath the standard gifts of
the past to the individual; they give stability. At
the same time, if rationally controlled they leave
energy free for new conquests. Vigor in the individual
commonly leads to dissatisfaction on his
part with institutions. Disorganization thus arises
from the reaction against institutional formalism
manifested by energetic individuals. It may be
regarded as a lack of communication between the
individual and the institution. Formalism indicates
that in certain particulars there has been an excess
of communication.</p>

<p>The economic concept of value has long been
analyzed in individualistic terms—the economic
desires arise out of “the inscrutable depths of the
private mind.” To this explanation Professor
Cooley replies that economic wants, interests, and
values are primarily of institutional origin; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
are socially created. Pecuniary valuations are
largely the products of group conditions and activities.</p>

<p>It is in a rational public will that Professor
Cooley sees the salvation of the social process.
While he repeatedly expresses a large degree of
faith in human nature as it is, he looks forward
to a day, rather remote, when communication and
education will enable all individuals to take a large
grasp of human situations and on the basis of this
grasp to express effectual social purposes. Unconscious
adaptation will be superseded by the deliberate
self-direction of every group along lines of
broadening sympathy and widening intellectual
reaches.</p>

<p>Professor Cooley has earned the title of a sound,
sane, and deep sociological thinker. His contributions
to social thought are found in his lucid descriptions
of the social process from which personalities
and social organizations arise, in his keen
analysis of communication as the fundamental element
in progress, and in his emphasis upon rational
control through standards.</p>

<p>The year 1908 is a red letter year in the history
of socio-psychologic thought. In that year two
important treatises appeared, one written by
William McDougall and the other by Edward Alsworth
Ross. The former was developed from the
psychological standpoint; the latter, from the sociological
point of view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<p>Mr. McDougall considers social psychology
largely as a study of the social instincts of individuals;
Professor Ross concentrates attention
upon the suggestion and imitation phases of societal
life. In a sense Professor Ross begins his analysis
where Mr. McDougall concludes.</p>

<p>Mr. McDougall treats the instincts as the bases
of social life. He makes them the foundation of
nearly all individual and social activities.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-18" href="#Footnote_XXIII-18" class="fnanchor">XXIII-18</a> Instincts
are biologically inherited; they cannot be eradicated
by the individual. Instincts constitute the materials
out of which habits are made. Consciousness arises
only when an instinct or a habit (that is, a modified
instinct) fails to meet human needs.</p>

<p>The primary instincts are the sex and parental,
the gregarious, curiosity, flight, repulsion. Each is
accompanied by its peculiar emotion, for example,
the instinct of flight by the emotion of fear, the instinct
of curiosity by the emotion of wonder. This
instinct-emotion theory is, however, drawn out
until it seems to become academic rather than actual
in its details.</p>

<p>Professor McDougall points out that the instincts
are the basic elements upon which all social institutions
are built.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-19" href="#Footnote_XXIII-19" class="fnanchor">XXIII-19</a> For example, the sex and parental
instincts are the foundations of the family; the
acquisitive instinct is an essential condition of the
accumulation of material wealth and of the rise of
private property as an institution. Pugnaciousness
leads to war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

<p>This emphasis upon the instincts reaches an extreme
form in W. Trotter’s <i>Instincts of the Herd
in Peace and War</i>, where the herd instinct is made
all-dominant. According to Mr. Trotter the herd
instinct arouses fear in the individual and rules him
through rigorous conventional means—in a large
percentages of cases to his detriment.</p>

<p>In conjunction with his theory of instincts, Professor
McDougall has advanced a noteworthy conception
of the sentiments. The three leading expressions
of sentiment are love, hate, and respect.
Sympathy is regarded as an elemental sentiment, in
fact, as an emotion in its simplest form. A sentiment
is “an organized system of emotional tendencies
centered about some object.” The sentiments
comprise an important phase of the self, and function
powerfully in determining social conduct.</p>

<p>It was in 1901 that Professor E. A. Ross made
his initial contribution to psycho-sociologic thought—seven
years before his <i>Social Psychology</i> was
published. His first great work was <i>Social Control</i>.
In this excursus he defined social psychology as the
study of “the psychic interplay between man and
his environing society.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-20" href="#Footnote_XXIII-20" class="fnanchor">XXIII-20</a> This interplay is two-fold:
the domination of society over the individual
(social ascendancy); and the domination of the individual
over society (individual ascendancy). Social
ascendancy may be either purposeless (social
influence) or purposeful (social control). Social
psychology, according to Professor Ross, deals with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
psychic planes and currents; it does not treat of
groups, which is a part of the preserve of psychological
sociology.</p>

<p>The psycho-sociologic grounds of control are
found in such factors as sympathy, sociability, an
elemental sense of justice, and particularly in group
needs. There are individuals whose conduct exasperates
the group. “In this common wrath and
common vengeance lies the germ of a social control
of the person.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-21" href="#Footnote_XXIII-21" class="fnanchor">XXIII-21</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Professor Ross’ discussion
of social control is his analysis of the agents
of control.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-22" href="#Footnote_XXIII-22" class="fnanchor">XXIII-22</a> Public opinion and law are the two
most important means of controlling individuals.
The weakness of one, in this connection, is its fitfulness;
of the other, its rigidity. Personal beliefs
and ideals function widely and effectively because
of their subjective character. An individual may
escape the operation of law; he can hide away from
the winds of public opinion; but he cannot get away
from his own ideas and conscience. It is for this
reason that religious convictions are powerful. Art
as a means of social control is commonly underrated.
It arouses the passions, kindles sympathies,
creates a sense of the beautiful and perfects social
symbols, such as Columbia, La Belle France,
Britannia.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-23" href="#Footnote_XXIII-23" class="fnanchor">XXIII-23</a></p>

<p>Systems of social control are political or moral.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-24" href="#Footnote_XXIII-24" class="fnanchor">XXIII-24</a>
The political form is more or less objective, is likely
to be in the hands of a few, is apt to be used for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
class benefit. The ethical arises from sentiment
rather than from utility; it is more or less subjective;
it permeates the hidden recesses of life. The
ethical system is usually mild, enlightening and
suasive “rather than bold and fear-engendering.”
Individuals are ordinarily aware of political control,
but the far-reaching influences of ethical control
they little suspect.</p>

<p>The two most difficult problems for society to
solve in connection with social control are these:
(1) what measures of control may be best imposed;
and (2) how these measures should be imposed.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-25" href="#Footnote_XXIII-25" class="fnanchor">XXIII-25</a>
The variety of disciplines which society may use
varies from epithets to capital punishment. The
methods vary from the democratic one of social
self-infliction to the direct autocratic procedure.
Too much control produces either stagnation or
revolution, depending on the amount of energy the
rank and file may possess. Too little control leads
to anarchy, or at least to a reign of selfishness. A
paternal social control may cause resentment or a
crushing of self-respect.</p>

<p>Suggestion and imitation are social elements that
Professor Ross has described in detail.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-26" href="#Footnote_XXIII-26" class="fnanchor">XXIII-26</a> He has
demonstrated that the more gregarious species are
more suggestible than the species whose members
are more or less solitary; that southern races are
more suggestible than northern races, because of
the different climatic effects upon temperament;
that children are more suggestible than adults, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
children possess a small store of facts and an
undeveloped ability to criticize; that people of a
nervous temperament are more suggestible than
persons who are phlegmatic, because of difference
in sensibility; that women are more suggestible than
men, because they have not had the broadening influences
which men have enjoyed, such as “higher
education, travel, self-direction, professional pursuits,
participation in intellectual and public life.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-27" href="#Footnote_XXIII-27" class="fnanchor">XXIII-27</a></p>

<p>The laws of imitation, particularly of fashion
imitation and rational imitation, which M. Tarde
was the first to outline, have been elucidated and
illustrated by Professor Ross. He has cut boldly
into the shams of fashion, convention, and custom,
and made a strong plea for rationality in these
fields. He has shown how mob mind, the craze, and
the fad sweep not simply the foolish and lightheaded
individuals off their feet, but also the persons
who are counted as sane and acquainted with
common sense. In fact, he has made clear that even
the most level-headed are blindly or slavishly governed
by custom or fashion or both. He does not
develop, however, the fact that imitation is largely
a result of like-mindedness and common social
stimuli. He implies an individual rather than a
group origin of suggestion-imitation phenomena.</p>

<p>It is in discussion that Professor Ross sees one
of the main hopes of progress.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-28" href="#Footnote_XXIII-28" class="fnanchor">XXIII-28</a> Discussion brings
conflicts to a head, and leads to group progress.
Discussion changes a person’s opinions. Adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
discussion leads to the settlement of a conflict and
the creation of an established public opinion, which
remains in force until a new invention occurs, a resultant
conflict ensues, and a new public opinion
comes into power.</p>

<p>In 1920, Professor Ross made his largest and
most important contribution to social thought in his
<i>Principles of Sociology</i>. This work, however, is
essentially a treatise in social psychology. The original
social forces are the human instincts, notably
the fighting instinct, the gregarious instinct, the
parental instinct, the curiosity instinct. The derivative
social forces are societal complexes which tend
to satisfy instinctive cravings. Professor Ross’
classification of the derivative social forces, or interests,
is primarily fourfold. These fundamental
interests are wealth, government, religion, and
knowledge. This classification contains only two,
or at best three, of the six groups of interests which
are found in Professor Small’s exhibit.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-29" href="#Footnote_XXIII-29" class="fnanchor">XXIII-29</a></p>

<p>Professor Ross’ analysis of the process of socialization
has been indicated in <a href="#Chapter_XXI">Chapter XXI</a>. This
phenomena is to be sharply distinguished from ossification,
which is the hardening of social life into
rigid forms.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-30" href="#Footnote_XXIII-30" class="fnanchor">XXIII-30</a> Groups often become unduly solidified.
The salvation of such a situation lies in individuation,
which is a process of pulverizing social
lumps and releasing the action of their members.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-31" href="#Footnote_XXIII-31" class="fnanchor">XXIII-31</a>
Any movement that develops that spirit of personal
liberty leads to individuation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p>“Commercialization is the increasing subjection
of any calling or function to the profits motive.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-32" href="#Footnote_XXIII-32" class="fnanchor">XXIII-32</a>
The various factors which hold the profits motive in
check are: (1) pleasure in creative activity; (2)
pride in the perfection of one’s product; (3) the desire
to live up to accepted standards of excellence;
(4) abhorrence of sham in one’s work; (5) interest
in the welfare of the customer; (6) the social service
motive. The profits motive, however, receives
support from many social tendencies, notably: (1)
the increasing distance between producer and consumer;
(2) the growing differentiation between
principals and subordinates; (3) the increasing importance
of capital in the practice of an art or occupation.</p>

<p>Professor Ross has set forth a valuable exhibit of
the canons of social reconstruction.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-33" href="#Footnote_XXIII-33" class="fnanchor">XXIII-33</a> (1) Reforms
must not do violence to human nature. (2) They
must square with essential realities. (3) They
should be preceded by a close sociological study of
the situation which it is planned to change. (4)
Reforms should be tried out on a small scale before
being adopted on a large scale. (5) A reform
should be the outcome of a social movement. (6)
Under a popular government, reforms should move
according to legal and constitutional methods.</p>

<p>In regard to the improvement of social institutions,
Professor Ross rests his argument on the importance
of standards. “Standards are, perhaps,
the most important things in society.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-34" href="#Footnote_XXIII-34" class="fnanchor">XXIII-34</a> Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
invisible and intangible they reveal, better than anything
else, the quality of a society.</p>

<p>The current standards of the family may be improved
through imparting sound ideals of marriage,
through fixing these ideals everywhere in social tradition,
and through making “the social atmosphere
frosty toward foolish and frivolous ideals of marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-35" href="#Footnote_XXIII-35" class="fnanchor">XXIII-35</a>
Young people may well be taught to look
upon divorce as a moral shipwreck. Loyalty to the
state or society has its origin in the obedience of
children to parents in the family. A sound family
life, thus, is rated by our author as the bulwark of
society.</p>

<p>In regard to industry, it is pointed out that the
principle of the sovyet is associated in an entirely
accidental way with Bolshevism.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-36" href="#Footnote_XXIII-36" class="fnanchor">XXIII-36</a> The sovyet may
well be judged on its own merits. The principle
upon which citizens may be grouped for purposes of
securing representation in government is not yet
settled. Is a given geographical area a better unit
for securing representation than occupational
areas?</p>

<p>State socialism is objected to by Professor Ross
on the grounds that it leaves the citizens so remote
“from that which most vitally concerns him, viz.,
the regulation of the industry in which he works,
that his yearly vote may be a mere fribble and he
little better than a state serf.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-37" href="#Footnote_XXIII-37" class="fnanchor">XXIII-37</a> Guild socialism, on
the other hand, urges that each branch of industry
shall organize itself democratically, and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
state shall be organized not with provinces and localities
as semi-autonomies but with industries exercising
a degree of autonomy. Our author endorses
the general shift which is occurring at the
present time from the coercive side to the service
side of industrial life.</p>

<p>Professor Ross has deduced several important
sociological principles of general import. These he
calls the principle of anticipation, the principle of
simulation, the principle of individualization, and
the principle of balance.</p>

<p>By the principle of anticipation, he means that a
known policy of an institution will come to be anticipated
by the members of the institution and will
result in modifying behavior.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-38" href="#Footnote_XXIII-38" class="fnanchor">XXIII-38</a> Unfair advantage
is often taken of people on the basis of this principle.
For example, children frequently count on
favor and leniency. The false beggar’s whine is
often effective. It is in this connection that genuine
social reform differs from a common conception of
charity, for the former method fits people to run,
clears their course, and incites them to make the
race,<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-39" href="#Footnote_XXIII-39" class="fnanchor">XXIII-39</a> while the latter fails to render assistance of
permanent value.</p>

<p>The principle of simulation refers to the common
tendency of “the unworthy to simulate every type
or trait which has won social approval, in order to
steal prestige from it.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-40" href="#Footnote_XXIII-40" class="fnanchor">XXIII-40</a> Commercial competition
has produced adulterations, misbrandings, counterfeiting.
There is the professional athlete, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
sometimes poses as a sincere enthusiast for physical
development. Politicians are often expert dissemblers.</p>

<p>The principle of individualization refers to giving
individuality a reasonable chance for growth.
As society grows more complex, institutions more
ossified, and life more standardized, the average individual
is increasingly in danger of being crushed;
at least, his opportunities for self-expression grow
more slim. There is need of constant vigilance in
education in allowing for individual differences, in
industry for safeguarding the laborer in expressing
his personality in his work, in government in permitting
free discussion.</p>

<p>The principle of balance is stated by Professor
Ross as follows: “In the guidance of society each
social element should share according to the intelligence
and public spirit of its members and none
should predominate.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-41" href="#Footnote_XXIII-41" class="fnanchor">XXIII-41</a> There has been in the past,
and even now there is in all countries, a bitter struggle
taking place between classes apparently on the
basis that some one class should rule all the other
classes. Society has suffered immeasurably in this
way. Sometimes society has been the victim of the
rulership of the dead, of the rulership of masculinism,
of clericalism, of militarism, of commercialism,
of legalism, of leisure class ascendancy, of intellectualism,
of proletarianism, but always by one class
lording it over the weaker classes until some one of
the weaker classes acquires strength enough to overthrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
the class in power.</p>

<p>The socio-psychological thought of Professor
Ross has penetrated the farthermost reaches of
human life. It has been stated in lucid, stimulating
language. It has commanded the attention of socially-thinking
persons in many lands. It has defined
the field of sociology, giving the psychological
approach.</p>

<p>Special attention may be given to the concept of
“the great society” as used by Graham Wallas. The
Great Society is a name for current human society,
the product of mechanical inventions, industrial
production, commercial expansion, democratic evolution—highly
organized and intricately complex.
It is ruled, in the main, by men “who direct enormous
social power without attempting to form a
social purpose,” and it is composed to a surpassing
degree of individuals who recognize the power of
society but dimly and who often treat society with
distrust and dislike.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-42" href="#Footnote_XXIII-42" class="fnanchor">XXIII-42</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wallas substitutes organization for organism
as a fundamental social concept. He makes a
distinction between thought organizations, will organizations,
and happiness organizations. Thought
organizations are those institutions in society whose
main function is the organization of thought, such
as discussion groups, ranging from a philosophical
club to an ordinary committee that is called together
to plan new legislation. At this point Mr. Wallas
asserts that he has attended perhaps 3000 meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
of municipal committees, of different sizes and for
different purposes, and that he is sure that at least
half of the men and women with whom he has sat
“were entirely unaware that any conscious mental
effort on their part was called for.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-43" href="#Footnote_XXIII-43" class="fnanchor">XXIII-43</a> They attended
in the same spirit that many persons attend
church, namely, in the spirit that if they merely
attend they are doing their duty, and that some good
must come of it.</p>

<p>Will organization comes into existence because
of imperfect social machinery. In industry three
types of will organizations are striving for mastery—the
institution of private property, represented
by the individualists; the state, represented by collectivists;
labor organizations, represented perhaps
by syndicalists. There is urgent need for “the invention
of means of organizing the conflicting wills
of individuals and classes within each nation more
effective than reliance upon any single ‘principle,’
whether representation, property, or professionalism.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-44" href="#Footnote_XXIII-44" class="fnanchor">XXIII-44</a></p>

<p>The organization of happiness has not proceeded
far. Efficiency has supplanted happiness as a modern
god. The ideal of making money has shadowed
the ideal of making people happy. A social system
organized on the basis of happiness avoids both destitution
and superfluity, employs the Mean as the
standard for the representation of all social interests
as well as for all faculties of individuals, avoids
the Extreme in all things.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-45" href="#Footnote_XXIII-45" class="fnanchor">XXIII-45</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span></p>

<p>The writings of Charles A. Ellwood deal particularly
with that part of sociological thought which
rests upon psychological theory. Professor Ellwood
defines a society as “a group of individuals carrying
on a collective life by means of mental interactions.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-46" href="#Footnote_XXIII-46" class="fnanchor">XXIII-46</a>
As a result of mental interactions, co-ordination
or co-adaptation of the activities of the
members is effected.</p>

<p>The psychological basis of social interactions is
found in such characteristics of the individual as
spontaneity, instincts, emotions, consciousness,
mind. Organisms possess spontaneity, that is,
movements are set up in them without the apparent
aid of external causes.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-47" href="#Footnote_XXIII-47" class="fnanchor">XXIII-47</a> The organism, however,
is dependent largely upon the environment for the
development of its potentialities, “but the essential
ground for the beginning of its activities lies
within—in its own organic needs.” Instincts, the
product of natural selection, represent preformed
neurological pathways that developed “in response
to the demands of previous life conditions.” The
emotions, also hereditary, are complexes of feelings
and sensations. The desires are complex combinations
of feelings and impulses which are accompanied
by an awareness of the objects that will
satisfy the impulse.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-48" href="#Footnote_XXIII-48" class="fnanchor">XXIII-48</a> Consciousness develops to
solve problems which the instincts cannot meet. At
first, consciousness is largely a selective activity. It
develops, however, into a highly complex agency for
mastering the problems of life and the universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
Mind is a product of the social life-process. It has
arisen under conditions of association.</p>

<p>One of the most fundamental phases of the associational
process is communication. The need of
acting together has given rise to intercommunicative
symbols.</p>

<p>Professor George H. Mead has given a thoroughgoing
discussion of communication, language, and
the consciousness of meaning.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-49" href="#Footnote_XXIII-49" class="fnanchor">XXIII-49</a> He begins with a
social situation, where the actions of one person
serve as stimulations to other persons, whose responses
in turn act as stimulations to the first person.
Thus life is a series of actions, stimulations,
responses, resultant stimulations—these activities
constitute gestures or symbols with meanings.
Symbols and the consciousness of meaning of these
symbols are the main elements in communication.</p>

<p>Communication, says Professor Ellwood, is “a
device to carry on a common life-process among
several distinct, though psychically interacting, individual
units.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-50" href="#Footnote_XXIII-50" class="fnanchor">XXIII-50</a> This definition probably emphasizes
unduly the “individual units,” which are
doubtless a product, in part, of the stream of social
life. Suggestion is an elemental, but quick form of
communication, related in its simpler phases to sympathetic
emotion. Imitation is a common mechanism
whereby actions and ideas spread. Communication
in the form of oral and written language is
the chief mechanistic factor in securing social
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<p>The contention of Ward that primitive man was
anti-social is refuted by Professor Ellwood, who
points out that according to social anthropology the
so-called anti-social traits of earliest man are not
found fully developed among “savages” but among
people of later ages. Primitives were characterized
by a narrow sociality, confined largely to the family
and small groups.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-51" href="#Footnote_XXIII-51" class="fnanchor">XXIII-51</a></p>

<p>Professor Ellwood’s theory of social change is of
a two-fold character: unconscious and conscious,—the
former being characteristic of the lower stages
of social evolution, and the latter, increasingly characteristic
of the higher stages.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-52" href="#Footnote_XXIII-52" class="fnanchor">XXIII-52</a> The forms of unconscious
social change are manifold.</p>

<p>Natural selection tends to crush and destroy the
weaker individuals and the weaker groups. Another
type of unconscious social change is that
which comes through a gradual disuse of certain
cultural elements. One generation fails to copy the
preceding in all particulars. Another set of sources
of unconscious social change is found in the shifting
relationships between individuals that is produced
by “the increase of population, a new physical
environment, a new cultural contact, a new discovery
or a new invention.” In fact, Professor Ellwood
states that all social changes start in an unconscious
way.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-53" href="#Footnote_XXIII-53" class="fnanchor">XXIII-53</a></p>

<p>Conscious change begins with the awareness on
the part of one or more individuals that some social
habit is not functioning well. Through communication,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
this awareness spreads from individual to
individual. Discussion ensues. At first, discussion
is largely critical of the unsatisfactory social situation.
The useless or harmful elements in the situation
receive first attention. As discussion proceeds,
it takes on a more constructive nature, that
is, it becomes projective, planful, positive. It suggests
a change to be made. It becomes transformed
into a more or less stable public opinion, demanding
a substitution of a proposed way of doing for
the old. The chief elements in guaranteeing conscious
readjustments are free communication, “free
public criticism, free discussion, untrammeled formation
of public opinion, free selection of social
policies and social leaders.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-54" href="#Footnote_XXIII-54" class="fnanchor">XXIII-54</a> The selective process
in conscious social change is public opinion, whose
social function it is to mediate in the transition
from one social habit to another.</p>

<p>Conscious social change in Western Civilization
is endangered on one hand by an excessive individualism,
and on the other by a socialism which
threatens to suppress individual initiative and to
underemphasize the rôle of mental and moral character.
Professor Ellwood urges the importance of
an education which will socialize the individual and
at the same time develop a high type of personal
character.</p>

<p>Social change, also, takes place under socially
abnormal conditions, so long as societies fail to keep
“a high degree of flexibility in their habits and institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-55" href="#Footnote_XXIII-55" class="fnanchor">XXIII-55</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
Autocratic rulers, propertied classes,
ecclesiastical classes, special groups in power, a
general intellectual stagnation, are factors which
tend to resist institutional flexibility. If this adaptability
does not exist, then social conditions will
produce revolutions. If the ruling autocracy is so
powerful that the lives of all objectors are snuffed
out, then revolution is indefinitely postponed. If
the energetic forces within a society are hampered
greatly in securing constructive opportunities for
expression, they become forces of discontent and
agents of revolt. If a revolution comes, then much
that is worthy in social organization will be obliterated
along with the unworthy, confusion will
reign and a reversion to the brutal stages of societal
life is easily possible.</p>

<p>In his discussion of “the social problem,” Professor
Ellwood points out that the good fruits of the
World War are in danger of being destroyed by
“the blindness and selfishness of some in our
socially privileged classes, the fanatic radicalism
and class hatred of some of the leaders of the non-privileged.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-56" href="#Footnote_XXIII-56" class="fnanchor">XXIII-56</a>
The forces which are combining
against making the world safe for democracy today
are national imperialism, commercialism, materialistic
standards of life, class conflicts, religious
agnosticism, and a reckless attitude toward marriage
and the family.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-57" href="#Footnote_XXIII-57" class="fnanchor">XXIII-57</a> The social problem, from
one angle, becomes the problem of training people
to live together justly, constructively, and co-operatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span></p>

<p>As
Turgot indicated, the only way to avert social
revolution is through suitable and well-timed reforms.
Today, the reforms most urgently needed
are three-fold: the substitution of an unselfish
internationalism for a selfish nationalism, of a
spiritual civilization for a rampant materialism,
and of a socialized human race for individualized
peoples. To bring about these changes is a gigantic
task, namely <em>the</em> social problem.</p>

<p>Civilization is a complex of social values. Professor
Ellwood’s classification of values is widely
different from the analysis that Professor Giddings
has made (given in the preceding chapter).
According to Professor Ellwood, western civilization
is represented by the following groups of
social values historically derived: (1) a set of
spiritual and ethical values, described by the
ancient Hebrews; (2) a set of esthetic and philosophic
concepts from the Greeks; (3) a set of administrative
and legal forms of Roman origin;
(4) a set of personal liberty beliefs of early Teutonic
derivation; (5) a scientific spirit and technique,
originating during the Renaissance; (6)
economic efficiency, born of the industrial revolution;
and (7) an extensive group of humanitarian
values, the product of the nineteenth century. This
vast and complicated Western Civilization needs,
however, to remove from its structure the three
“rotten pillars” of hyper-individualism, materialism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
and selfish nationalism, substituting for each
its spiritualized and socialized counterpart.</p>

<p>The nature of social control, according to the
analysis by Professor E. C. Hayes, is “to secure
the completed and most harmonious realization of
good human experience, regarded as an end in
itself.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-58" href="#Footnote_XXIII-58" class="fnanchor">XXIII-58</a> Social control should prevent activities
which do not bear the test of reason, and should
elicit those which stand that test, when judged by
their own intrinsic value and by their effect upon
other values. This statement of the purpose of
social control is similar to that of other standard
interpretations of the matter.</p>

<p>There are two types of social control.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-59" href="#Footnote_XXIII-59" class="fnanchor">XXIII-59</a> The first
is control by sanctions, and the second by social
suggestion, sympathetic radiation, and imitation.
Social sanctions refer to proffered rewards and
threatened punishments. Professor Hayes, however,
makes not law but personality the ultimate
basis of social order. Repression of crime is a
correct social procedure but of a distinctly lower
grade than the movement to raise the moral character
of those who never go to prison. <em>The</em> problem of
social control is to take the instinctive tendencies
of each individual when he is young and
make them over into a disposition that is characterized
by the four following traits: (1) reliability,
or honesty; (2) controlled animalism, or temperance

propensities; (3) steadiness in endeavor; (4) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
social spirit, or justice.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-60" href="#Footnote_XXIII-60" class="fnanchor">XXIII-60</a></p>

<p>Professor Hayes’ statement on the agencies of
social control is similar in purport to the list that
Professor Ross has given. Education is considered
the chief agency of social control. Education can
determine the direction of ambition; education can
shift the emphasis in social valuations. Professor
Hayes recognizes the import of heredity and how
the degree of individual achievement is “more dependent
upon heredity than upon the directions of
effort.” Society, however, has the power to decide
which of its members shall develop as far as their
potential abilities will permit, and also the power
to determine the direction the activities of its members
shall take.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-61" href="#Footnote_XXIII-61" class="fnanchor">XXIII-61</a></p>

<p>Among educational agencies of control the family
ranks first.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-62" href="#Footnote_XXIII-62" class="fnanchor">XXIII-62</a> The power of the family at its best
in building personality is comparable to the influence
in this connection of all other agencies combined.
The profession of mother-work is more
important to society than any other profession.</p>

<p>The social psychology of business enterprise, of
the leisure classes, of the machine process, of industry
and workmanship have been indicated by
Thorstein Veblen. The unique, incisive work of
Mr. Veblen is presented in several books, chief of
which are his <i>Theory of the Leisure Class</i>, <i>Theory
of Business Enterprise</i>, and <i>Instinct of Workmanship</i>.
Mr. Veblen’s ideas can best be illustrated by
referring to his “canons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span></p>

<p>The Canon of Pecuniary Emulation describes the
restless straining of certain individuals in society
to outdo one another in the possession of wealth.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-63" href="#Footnote_XXIII-63" class="fnanchor">XXIII-63</a>
Such possession is interpreted as conferring honor
on its possessor. Wealth becomes intrinsically
honorable. The Canon of Pecuniary Beauty refers
to the impression that things are beautiful in proportion
as they are costly.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-64" href="#Footnote_XXIII-64" class="fnanchor">XXIII-64</a> The marks of expensiveness
come to be regarded as beautiful features.</p>

<p>The Canon of Conspicuous Consumption is a
term which describes a method of showing off one’s
wealth by an elaborate consumption of goods.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-65" href="#Footnote_XXIII-65" class="fnanchor">XXIII-65</a>
Conspicuous consumption is seen more in matters
of dress than in any other line of consumption.
The Canon of Conspicuous Leisure is the rule
which some people are following when they live a
life of leisure as the readiest and most conclusive
evidence of pecuniary strength.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-66" href="#Footnote_XXIII-66" class="fnanchor">XXIII-66</a> Sometimes a man
keeps his wife frittering her time away in a doll’s
house in order to show his wealth status.</p>

<p>The Canon of Leisure Class Conservatism is
Veblen’s label for the conservative tendencies of the
wealthy. Those whom fortune has greatly favored
are likely to be content with things as they are.
Such people are averse to social change, for social
innovation might upset their comfortable existence.
They have a dominant material interest in letting
things alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Veblen’s Canon of Pecuniary Efficiency
means that many persons conceive of efficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
largely in terms of price. The person who can induce
his fellows to pay him well is accounted efficient
and serviceable.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-67" href="#Footnote_XXIII-67" class="fnanchor">XXIII-67</a> The man who gains much
wealth at little cost is rated high in his neighbor’s
esteem. The investor who at the turn of his hand
reaps $100,000 in a stock or bond deal is praised
widely. In other words, there is a common tendency
to rate people high in direct proportion to
the amount of money that they are able to extract
from the aggregate product.</p>

<p>The Canon of Bellicoseness refers to the enthusiasm
for war which the hereditary leisure class
displays. The very wealthy, not being obliged to
work for a living, find that time drags. Therefore,
they seek excitement and relief from ennui, and
find these conditions in various things, especially
in war.</p>

<p>The Canon of Pecuniary Education covers the
tendency to demand “practical” education, which,
upon examination, is education that will guarantee
individual success. “Success,” for which education
is to fit young people, turns out to be, in the eyes of
the practical man, a pecuniary success. “Practical”
means useful for private gain. The test that many
persons would give to a course in education is
this: Will it help one to get an income? The Canon
of Pecuniary Thinking denotes that many occupations
lead to habits of pecuniary thought. For
numbers of people the beginning and end of their
more serious thought is of a pecuniary nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span></p>

<p>The Canon of Machine Process Thinking is that
mechanical employments produce a type of thinking
that is based more or less on material cause and
effect. The Machine knows neither morality nor
dignity nor prescriptive right. The machine process
laborers, working in a world of impersonal cause
and effect, “are in danger of losing the point of
view of sin.”</p>

<p>Professor Veblen has developed the concept of
the instinct of workmanship at considerable length.
According to this contention, it is natural for individuals
to do, to construct, to achieve, to work.
Through activity the individual expresses himself
and, in so doing, develops, and attains happiness.
Every individual is a center of unfolding impulsive
activity; he is possessed of a taste for effective
work.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-68" href="#Footnote_XXIII-68" class="fnanchor">XXIII-68</a> Labor acquires a character of irksomeness
by virtue of the indignity that is falsely imputed to
it by a hereditary leisure class.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-69" href="#Footnote_XXIII-69" class="fnanchor">XXIII-69</a> It was the instinct
of workmanship which brought the life of mankind
from the brute to the human plan.</p>

<p>The contributions of Mr. Veblen to social thought
are always of a thought-provoking nature. Sometimes
they give rise to invidious comparisons, often
they antagonize, but as a rule, they are unique.
No brief reference such as is given in the foregoing
paragraphs can do justice to Mr. Veblen’s pungent
criticisms of societal foibles.</p>

<p>It would be a decidedly incomplete treatment of
the nature of psycho-sociologic thought that did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
not make reference to the work of George Elliott
Howard, political scientist, historian, sociologist,
but above all, social psychologist. In each of the
fields in which Dr. Howard has achieved fame, his
method of approach is psychological. He has prepared
an excellent outline of the field of social
psychology, together with a scholarly bibliography
of the same. Perhaps the best way to treat Professor
Howard’s socio-psychologic thought, is to give a
sample of it, as found in his address before the
American Sociological Society when he was president
of that body. The theme was, “Ideals as a
Factor in the Future Control of International Society.”
This <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magnum opus</i> served as an excellent
introduction to the series of papers on the subject
of social control which were read at the annual
meeting of the Sociological Society in 1918, and
which have been published together with the presidential
address as Volume XII of the Publications
of the Society.</p>

<p>By social control, Professor Howard means the
standard conception of the “ascendency of the social
consciousness.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-70" href="#Footnote_XXIII-70" class="fnanchor">XXIII-70</a> In the same volume, however,
Professor Carl Kelsey interprets social control as
“the organization and utilization of our wealth and
citizens for private purposes.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-71" href="#Footnote_XXIII-71" class="fnanchor">XXIII-71</a> Professor Hutton
Webster is inclined to believe that the main feature
of primitive social control is “the superstitious fear
of the new.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-72" href="#Footnote_XXIII-72" class="fnanchor">XXIII-72</a> Professor F. Stuart Chapin sees the
essential element of primitive social ascendency in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
the pressure upon the individual of social conditions,
customs, and conventions.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-73" href="#Footnote_XXIII-73" class="fnanchor">XXIII-73</a> Without giving
additional interpretations of social control, the
reader will be referred directly to Volume XII of
the Publications as the best symposium that is available
on the subject.</p>

<p>In discussing ideals as a phase of international
control, Professor Howard makes clear that certain
ideals exert a baneful influence. The ideal of the
nation-state appears to be unmoral if not immoral.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-74" href="#Footnote_XXIII-74" class="fnanchor">XXIII-74</a>
Of four prevailing standards of ethics, namely, personal
morality, business morality, national morality
for home consumption, and “standards of international
morality for use with outlanders,” the
scale is descending, and the fourth type is the lowest.
Nationalisms have been overdeveloped—at the
expense of a needed internationalism.</p>

<p>Another false ideal of which society needs to rid
itself is its conception of the function of war and
militarism. War is not a good in itself. War as
war is not heroic. Race values constitute a third
false ideal. “Every race deems itself superior to
every other race and every race is mistaken.”<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-75" href="#Footnote_XXIII-75" class="fnanchor">XXIII-75</a>
Race conceit is contrary to the Christian ideal and
has steadily been supplanted by the new doctrine of
the potential equality of all races.</p>

<p>The ideal of democracy, on the other hand, rings
true to the needs of progress. It makes for peace.
Democracy, however, must rid itself of blemishes.
Hereditary and class privilege must be abolished;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
political corruption and race riots must be defeated;
woman, “the original social builder, the mother of
industry, the first inventor of the arts of peace,”
must be granted a full voice in social control.</p>

<p>The ideal of education is exceedingly delicate,
for it involves the process of the changing of ideals.
Education may prepare a people to admire autocracy
or to build a self-governing democracy.</p>

<p>Dr. Howard enters a strong plea for social
idealism—the most effective that has yet been
written.<a id="FNanchor_XXIII-76" href="#Footnote_XXIII-76" class="fnanchor">XXIII-76</a> “The idealist is the inspired social architect,
who dreams a plan for the sanitary or moral
cleansing of a great city; the campaign for purging
politics of graft; a law for saving little children
from the tigerish man of the factory or the sweatshop;
a referendum for banishing from the commonwealth
the saloon, that chief breeder of pauperism,
sin, and crime; a conference for the rescuing
from the hands of predacious greed, for the use of
the whole people, of the remnant of our country’s
natural wealth. The idealist is the statesman—the
head of a nation—who dreams a scheme for
safeguarding democracy and guaranteeing peace
throughout the world.”</p>

<p>It is evident from the introduction to the history
of psycho-sociologic thought that has been given in
this and the preceding chapter, supported by the
materials in the chapters on social conflict and
social co-operation concepts, that psycho-sociologic
thought holds a place of first rank in the field of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
sociology. It bids fair to become the central force
in social thinking and to lead the social sciences.
It deals with the most vital social concepts, namely,
groups, personality, behavior, conflict, co-operation,
and process. Of all the main approaches to an
understanding of societary problems, it promises
most.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_423"><span class="smcap" id="Chapter_XXIV">Chapter XXIV</span><br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Trend of Applied Sociology</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the preceding chapters the discussions have
dealt primarily with the philosophic and psychologic
phases of social thought. Another important phase
of our field is applied sociology. The hosts of
individuals who have been engaged in dealing directly
with societal problems have learned valuable
lessons from their personal experiences. Sometimes
they have labored according to false theories;
often they have scorned theories entirely. At the
other extreme, the world has often accepted fine
theories, but made a pitiable spectacle of itself in
falling away from its idealistic professions.</p>

<p>As the term implies, applied sociology treats of
techniques for improving the quality of human living.
The best techniques have been developed experimentally,
but by persons who have combined a
high estimate of social theory with practical programs
of activity. The useful concept of social
technology, a more accurate term perhaps than
applied sociology, was given to society by Charles
R. Henderson, whose balanced thinking, sane judgment,
and important ameliorative activities made
him the founder of this branch of sociological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
science. Dr. Henderson’s name is synonymous
with a practical interpretation of both democracy
and Christianity, with the spirit of vigorous yet
kindly reformation in penology, with the concept of
prevention in philanthropic endeavors, and with
justice and love in all the fields of human achievement.
There are many other important names in
the list of those persons who helped to found applied
sociology; for example, such individuals as
Canon Barnett, Arnold Toynbee, Jacob Riis, Jane
Addams, and many other social welfare saints.</p>

<p>Poverty and crime have been the two chief phenomena
with which welfare work has been concerned.
Until the present century the attempts to
meet the problems of poverty have been largely
remedial. Jesus said that the poor are always
present in any age of society. St. Francis of Assisi,
tiring of monastery life, sought out the poor
in the natural walks of life, and dedicated himself
in their behalf.</p>

<p>For centuries England has experimented with
solutions for the problems of poverty and pauperism.
She has learned that when she cares too assiduously
for the poor she encourages the spirit of
pauperism and increases the numbers of dependents.
When she provided liberal aid for illegitimate
children, she found that illegitimacy was furthered.</p>

<p>England has had a series of important literary
leaders who have interested themselves in behalf of
the poor and outcast. Dickens drew minute word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
pictures of poverty. Carlyle, the iconoclast and individualist,
pierced repeatedly the shams of society
which are partly responsible for the perpetual existence
of social misery. In beautiful diction Ruskin
spoke in behalf of social justice. In similar fields,
France has her Hugo and Balzac; Germany, her
Hauptmann; Russia, her Tolstoi and Gorky; Scandinavia,
her Bjornson, Ibsen, and Strindberg. Individuals
of this type, however, cannot be considered
social technologists. They have directed public
opinion to specific social problems, but rarely
offered technological programs of practical value.</p>

<p>Since 1900, the leaders in social technology, such
as C. R. Henderson,<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-1" href="#Footnote_XXIV-1" class="fnanchor">XXIV-1</a> Sidney and Beatrice Webb,<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-2" href="#Footnote_XXIV-2" class="fnanchor">XXIV-2</a>
and E. T. Devine,<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-3" href="#Footnote_XXIV-3" class="fnanchor">XXIV-3</a> have made clear the specific conditions
under which the poor may be permanently
aided.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-4" href="#Footnote_XXIV-4" class="fnanchor">XXIV-4</a> Remedial care will always be necessary,
but it must be offered in ways that will not encourage
anyone to make a living by begging. The
prevailing thought today regarding poverty is in
preventive terms. The individual should be shown
how to help himself up the economic pathway. Education
will make the individual efficient and safeguard
him against falling into a chronic state of
pauperism.</p>

<p>Above all else, social technology urges the establishment
of justice in economic conditions. As
shown in <a href="#Chapter_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>, Henry George, in his
<i>Progress and Poverty</i>, made a fundamental analysis
of one set of causes of poverty, which he found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
the unjust factors in the economic system. He
showed how ownership in land may be traced back
to force. Shall the first person who acquires a section
of land be allowed to fence it in and to keep out
all other persons unless they pay him a price that
rises rapidly as the number of other persons increases?<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-5" href="#Footnote_XXIV-5" class="fnanchor">XXIV-5</a>
Why is there increasing misery amid advancing
wealth? The larger the city the greater
the degree of squalor—this was George’s perplexing
observation. Material progress does not improve
the condition of the lowest classes. Prosperity
under the present economic system appears to be a
heavy wedge driven into society. The individuals
who are below the line of cleavage are crushed
down; those who are above this line are hoisted
upward into positions of luxury and affluence.</p>

<p>Henry George, despite the large number of followers
which his ideas have today, was probably in
error in believing that to take the ownership of
land out of the hands of individuals, through the
method of the single tax, would prevent poverty.
However, no one should be blind to the fact that
increasing land values result from mere increase
in population. Either the birth rate or immigration
increases population and sends up land values,
which in turn is accompanied by a rising scale of
rents with an elevated cost of living and increased
poverty.</p>

<p>The history of human thought concerning crime
has run a vicissitudinous career. It was not until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
the days of John Howard and Beccaria that a truly
scientific approach was made to the problem. John
Howard (1726–1790), sheriff of Bedford, became
interested in criminals. He visited jails throughout
England. He traveled widely in Europe,
usually at his own expense, studying the causes of
typhus fever and endeavoring to effect a more
humane treatment of offenders.</p>

<p>Beccaria (1735–1794), an Italian criminologist,
published in 1764 a remarkable book, <i>Crimes and
Punishment</i>. Beccaria protested against attempting
to repress crime by the use of fear. Retaliation
is an entirely inadequate motive for administering
punishment. Torture is inhuman. Neither retaliation
nor repression meets the problem. Reformation
was the concept with which Beccaria startled
Europe. Punishment should be administered so as
to reform.</p>

<p>In modern days the names of Cesare Lombroso
(1836–1909) stands out prominently in the field of
criminology.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-6" href="#Footnote_XXIV-6" class="fnanchor">XXIV-6</a> Lombroso was a determinist, finding
in heredity and environment all the causes of crime,
and relieving the individual of moral responsibility.
The mental defective, the alcoholic, the frantically
angry are irresponsible for the crimes they commit.
By defining one irresponsible group after another
the Lombrosan school has practically included all
individuals in this classification, leaving no one
responsible for his conduct.</p>

<p>The remedy for crime, according to Lombroso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
and his followers, is found in society. Society is
responsible for the criminal acts of its members. If
society should surround all individuals from infancy
with a favorable environment, then crime
would end. In the writings of Garofalo, Ferri, de
Quiros, Gross and other Continental criminologists,
a broader point of view is usually taken, making
the responsibility for crime to rest on three factors,
heredity, environment, and individual morality.
The margin of choice, and therefore of individual
responsibility, is usually made very slender. European
criminological experts, and even American
writers, such as Parmelee, have commonly minimized
the importance of moral character and the
accountability of the individual.</p>

<p>In the United States the trend of interest has
been penological. Since the days of William Penn,
who had been a prisoner in England, American
thought has centered on the problem of prison reform.
Barrows and Brockway devoted their lives
to the reorganization of prison procedure. Wines
and Lane show lucidly the trend in penological
thought, paying splendid tribute to the achievements
of Z. R. Brockway in establishing the Elmira
Reformatory (New York).<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-7" href="#Footnote_XXIV-7" class="fnanchor">XXIV-7</a></p>

<p>The fundamental principles of the Elmira procedure
are as follows: (1) The average prisoner
can be reformed. (2) Reformation of the prisoner
is the duty of the state. (3) Prisoners must be
considered as individuals and accorded the treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
which each needs in order to bring him to a
normal attitude of life. (4) The prisoner’s reformation
requires his own co-operation in the process.
(5) The prison must have the power to lengthen
or shorten the sentence according to the offender’s
stage of reformation. (6) The entire process of
reformation is educational, giving the offender opportunity
for psychical, mental, and moral growth.
(7) Punishment for crime is administered in the
discipline and labor, which are unremitting and
exacting.</p>

<p>In recent years Thomas M. Osborne has been
developing the honor system and self-government
among prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-8" href="#Footnote_XXIV-8" class="fnanchor">XXIV-8</a> The idea is dramatised by Burleigh
and Bierstadt in <i>Punishment</i>.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-9" href="#Footnote_XXIV-9" class="fnanchor">XXIV-9</a> The conception
is that kindly administration and the personal
touch of love will win the offender’s heart and
mind, and effect a reformation.</p>

<p>The last twenty years have seen a remarkable
development of the concept of prevention of crime.
This theory, however, takes the problem back to
pre-adult years, to the adolescent, to childhood,
and even to the pre-natal years of the specific individual.
The establishment of the juvenile court,
with the success of Judge Ben B. Lindsey, has
served to call attention to the fact that criminals are
made as a rule before they reach the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>The contributors to recent thought about delinquency,
such as Jane Addams, Breckinridge and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
Abbott, W. R. George, Ben B. Lindsey, Mrs. Louise
de Koven Bowen, Flexner and Baldwin, are pretty
largely agreed that the causes of delinquency, and
hence of criminality, are as follows: (1) The defective
home—made defective by illness, poverty,
shiftlessness, ignorance, immorality, desertion, divorce,
death—is the leading single causal element.
Nearly all criminals begin their careers as disobedient
sons. The law of obedience and self-discipline,
if not observed in the home, is learned
later only at the expense of anti-social and criminal
acts. (2) Mental defectiveness often causes delinquency.
The mentally defective child, if energetic,
has great difficulty in withstanding the evil
temptations of life. He or she has bodily passions
that are further developed than his mental inhibitions.
In this connection the public school has an
important function to perform in detecting mental
defectives and in segregating them under special
educational care. They should be segregated also
by sexes, so that they may not reproduce their kind,
and they should be kept under educational and institutional
direction throughout their lives. They
can be made useful and happy under a guarded
environment. (3) Civic neglect is a third cause of
delinquency and crime. Young people are released
from the public schools, often without proper home
training and supervision, and drift about in a highly
complex urban environment, full of commercialized
and vicious devices for preying upon the curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
and the unsuspecting. (4) Social injustice, for
example in industry, arouses feelings of hatred of
class against class, and leads to criminal acts.
(5) Moral thoughtlessness and religious indifference
are common causes. A moral and religious
attitude gives a balanced expression to personality,
wholesomeness and obedience in the home; and a
deep, constant, and abiding interest in public welfare
is an invaluable preventive of sin, vice, and
crime.</p>

<p>A growing conception relative to juvenile courts
is that a considerable portion of the work that such
courts are now called on to perform belongs to the
public schools. The compulsory attendance, child
welfare, and continuation school departments may
well assume responsibility for and direction of
many youth who now become court charges. It is
urged that a fully organized procedure of constructive
work and play activity under the supervision
of the schools will greatly reduce juvenile delinquency.</p>

<p>Another cause of juvenile delinquency is parental
negligence. It is believed by many authorities that
problems of this character should be taken care of
through the domestic relations court rather than in
the juvenile court. Another causal factor is the
growing disrespect for parents on the part of children,
that is, the increasing degree of failure of
children to appreciate the significance of the concept
of obedience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span></p>

<p>In regard to labor problems, social technology
has made notable contributions. Child labor is a
term which refers to the employment of adolescent
children for wages, when such children are thereby
deprived from normal opportunities of mental and
physical growth. Children should learn to work,
even at unpleasant tasks, but when at an early age
they are taken out of or quit school and become
gainfully employed, they are deprived of a normal
adolescence; they and society both lose.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-10" href="#Footnote_XXIV-10" class="fnanchor">XXIV-10</a></p>

<p>The problem of women in industry is due to the
migration of millions of women from the home into
industry. While women are entitled to equality of
opportunity with men, they are often unmindful
that constitutionally they are not fitted to perform
all the tasks that men are doing; that if they fail
in the bearing and rearing of children rationally,
the race dies; and that, if they neglect to make the
home attractive, the family as an essential social
institution is undermined.</p>

<p>The labor problem, when applied to men, brings
forth a multiplicity of contradictory opinions. The
idea of industrial democracy is the storm center.
While praising modern capitalism for its stimulus
to initiative and for its large-scale enterprises that
have been highly beneficial in many ways, the
social technologist pronounces modern capitalism
undemocratic. He declares that it must purge itself
or be supplanted by another industrial order; it
must take cognizance of social changes and adjust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
itself accordingly or be routed.</p>

<p>The injustice in modern capitalism is often
stressed in social technologic thought. Only one
factor, wealth, is represented in the management of
business. The skilled or unskilled laborers, often
“the hardest working partners” in the business, are
not represented. Applied sociology, unlike socialism,
would keep industry in the hands of individuals.
The idea has been best developed, perhaps,
by a social theorist, Professor A. W. Small. Labor
and capital must both have representation on
boards of directors, if capitalism is to prove that
it is not undemocratic.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-11" href="#Footnote_XXIV-11" class="fnanchor">XXIV-11</a></p>

<p>Tripartite management of industry is a current
phase of industrial thought. Where employers and
employees have reached a common ground of co-operation,
they have often joined forces in collusion
against the public and the consumer. The employer
agrees to a rise in wages for the employee, and the
employee to an increase in dividends, providing he
receives a portion of the added returns—meanwhile
the public is apathetic or rages impotently. The
best thought today is urging that on boards of directors
and managers all three interested parties
shall have representation, namely, labor, capital,
and the public.</p>

<p>It is a current opinion that the failure of capitalism
to democratize itself will result in the rise of
socialism by revolutionary means. If capital with its
one-sided control of industry is supplanted by labor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
with another type of control, it is doubtful how
much will be gained. The labor standard is manifesting
itself as a class standard, and at times
arbitrarily. To have society controlled by labor
standards, no matter under what form of socialism
they may appear, will not guarantee progress. The
labor classes, the capitalist classes, the professional
classes—all must rule, and unselfishly for the welfare
of society.</p>

<p>The current socialist thought ranges from a
radical bolshevist theme of a dictatorship of the
proletariat to a conservative state socialism, like
that advocated by John Spargo. Bolshevism has
the earmarks of class autocracy. Progress cannot
be secured by a social order in which the least educated
and trained are in control. On the other
hand, it is not clear that state socialism, with its
governmental control of interest-producing capital
and rent-producing land, will best guarantee
progress. The socialization of individuals will
probably be more effective than the socialization of
industries.</p>

<p>The tendency is toward the elimination of profitism.
This negative thought, it is claimed, will relieve
capitalism of its worst evils, and allow the
educational process of socializing individuals to go
forward.</p>

<p>The concept of social insurance has been given a
remarkable reception since 1882. Social insurance
was introduced as a means of pacifying labor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
of making it contented under the rule of capitalism.
It was admitted into governmental economy by Bismarck
as an agency of forestalling socialism. It
spread rapidly. It has met with two setbacks.
(1) In the first place it has acquired such momentum
that capitalism sees it as the entering
wedge of a genuine socialism. (2) In the second
place social insurance is guaranteeing so much security
to the workingman that he is constrained at
times to sacrifice his initiative and even to become
shiftless, saying in effect to himself, “I’ll be taken
care of anyway.” It is this second type of antagonistic
thought that indicates the real weakness
in social insurance. It would be better to have a
society in which the workingmen as a class would
have an ample opportunity of caring for, and be
stimulated to care for, their old age and for periods
of disability. For the individual exceptions, special
provisions could be made.</p>

<p>The unemployment problem has produced many
reform theories. Unemployment insurance, now being
made the subject of experiment, is probably not
reaching the main causes. The causal factors are
many and deep-seated; they range from individual
shiftlessness and mental defectiveness on one hand,
to economic injustice and social callousness on the
other.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-12" href="#Footnote_XXIV-12" class="fnanchor">XXIV-12</a> The prevailing thought urges a more efficient
training of the individual; the increasing of
the workman’s opportunity to enlarge his personality
through each day’s work; the development of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
industrial democracy and justice; and a complete
socialization program.</p>

<p>Another set of problems concerning which applied
sociology is endeavoring to find solutions relates to
the family, feminism, marriage, divorce, and housing.
Professor George Elliott Howard<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-13" href="#Footnote_XXIV-13" class="fnanchor">XXIV-13</a> and Dr.
Edward Westermarck<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-14" href="#Footnote_XXIV-14" class="fnanchor">XXIV-14</a> have traced the development
of the family and marriage throughout human history.
The primitive relationships between sexes have
been described by many anthropological writers. A
history of the American family has been written
by A. W. Calhoun.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-15" href="#Footnote_XXIV-15" class="fnanchor">XXIV-15</a> Single volume treatments of
the family as a social institution have been made by
Bosanquet<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-16" href="#Footnote_XXIV-16" class="fnanchor">XXIV-16</a> and Goodsell.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-17" href="#Footnote_XXIV-17" class="fnanchor">XXIV-17</a> These works essentially
agree that the family is an evolutionary product,
that the primitive family centered about the mother
and child, that patriarchalism introduced a high degree
of masculine arbitrariness, and that the family
is at present undergoing marked changes whereby
the spirit of democracy is gaining ground.</p>

<p>In the new found spirit of freedom, woman has
sometimes been captivated by the desire to follow
man into all the man-made occupations. Sex nature
predestines woman to the chief occupation or profession
of all, that of motherhood. For woman to
rush headlong after men into industry may turn
out to be not liberty, but license and deterioration.
Current social thought protests vigorously against
the idea of women being household drudges, and
also against women wasting their time in pluming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
themselves or in idling away their days in dolls’
houses, supported dependents of men. Women are
entitled to learn vocations and to live constructive
lives, in an atmosphere of the largest possible freedom
consistent with the development of themselves
and the race. On the other hand, any movement
which weakens the home as a societary training institution
apparently defies the laws of social advance.</p>

<p>The housing problem is provoking urgent
thought. With the rise of large cities the economic
order favors exorbitant land values and extraordinarily
high rents. The social increment goes into
the hands of the few. The flat and apartment house
life often favors pet bulldogs rather than children,
and decreases the efficiency of the home as a social
institution. These untoward tendencies, furthermore,
are being supplemented by an attitude of
more or less helpless apathy on the part of the
public.</p>

<p>Another field of applied sociologic thought is
represented by the terms, race problems, immigration,
and naturalization. These concepts are all
outgrowths of the population concept which has
been treated in an earlier chapter. The human race
with its common origin has subdivided and wandered
into all the inhabitable parts of the globe.
Climate, geography, and social environment have
operated to make the race subdivisions distinct and
discriminatory. Race pride and prejudice have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
raised impassable race barriers.</p>

<p>In the United States the leading race problem involves
the Negroes. Booker T. Washington<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-18" href="#Footnote_XXIV-18" class="fnanchor">XXIV-18</a> urged
that if the Negro shows himself industrially efficient
and morally worthy, the prejudice against him
will disappear. W. E. B. DuBois<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-19" href="#Footnote_XXIV-19" class="fnanchor">XXIV-19</a> asks that the
prejudice against the colored race by the white race
be removed in order that the Negro may have a fair
chance to show himself capable. The Southern
white people declare that the colored people must be
segregated on a lower plane than that occupied by
the white race. Northern people assert that the
trouble lies chiefly in an undemocratic attitude of
Southern white people toward the colored race.
Thus the currents of thought concerning the Negro
come into conflict, but without forming a common
current of action.</p>

<p>Another phase of the race problem is conveyed
by the concept of hyphenated interests. The Americanization
movement has assumed momentum because
of the need for a more unified spirit within
the nation. Although some of the promoters of
Americanization have used autocratic means, the
opinion is gaining ground that the transference of
the loyalty of the immigrant from his home country
to his adopted country can best be effected by
treating the immigrant sympathetically and democratically
in all his contacts—industrial, social, political—with
the people of our land.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-20" href="#Footnote_XXIV-20" class="fnanchor">XXIV-20</a></p>

<p>The public health movement has acquired force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
because of the belief that only public and widespread
action can remove many of the causes of
disease. Tuberculosis, for example, is a disease that
is caused by a microscopic germ which thrives and
multiplies in the tissues of susceptible and weakened
organisms. Tuberculosis and unsanitary housing
conditions flourish together. The individual is
often helpless, but the thought is now well grounded
that public action can stamp out the breeding places
of the tubercle bacilli and relieve the country of the
white plague. An improved economic and educational
status for the unskilled laborer and his family
would also help to improve the health level of the
country. Current social thought supports the contention
that the real work of a physician is to keep
people well rather than to cure them after they have
fallen seriously ill. Preventive medicine and the
public health movement are strongly urged by social
technology.</p>

<p>Another phase of applied sociology of current
significance is indicated by the term, community
organization.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-21" href="#Footnote_XXIV-21" class="fnanchor">XXIV-21</a> The idea of this movement originated
in the failure of people to develop a democratic
consciousness. Community organization refers
to attempts of communities to organize themselves
for neighborhood efficiency. When a community
organizes its own recreations and amusements,
it functions in two important directions. (1)
It supplants commercialized amusements, operated
for profit and often on a socially destructive basis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
by community recreation, maintained by the people
themselves in socially constructive ways and at a
minimum of expense. (2) In participating in and
building up community enterprises such as community
recreation, the people of the community develop
a co-operative democratic consciousness. The
problem of the use of leisure time is growing in
proportion to the extent that the laboring classes
are winning a shorter work day. In addition to
community recreation, community health movements,
community newspapers, community co-operative
stores, community committees for securing
needed legislation and for breaking the force of
economic monopoly, are attracting widespread attention.
The social unit and the block system of
community service, are terms which indicate variations
of the community organization concept, originally
a product of the need of meeting the leisure
time problem constructively with the very important
result of re-creating democracy.</p>

<p>Social technology has produced the survey.<a id="FNanchor_XXIV-22" href="#Footnote_XXIV-22" class="fnanchor">XXIV-22</a> The
social survey, being related in its origin to the census,
is an accurate method of gathering social facts,
not merely facts about the numbers of people, the
acreage, and the amount of wealth, but the facts
about the societary assets and liabilities of a city
or community, and concerning the constructive and
the destructive forces. By making surveys at regular
intervals of five or ten year periods, a community
can determine the amount and direction of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
own progress. The idea of a survey is similar to
that of an inventory of a business house—to find
out the gains and losses, and to plan for the future
according to the verdict of the inventory.</p>

<p>In recent years social case work has acquired an
important rank in the field of applied sociology.
Social reform deals with methods for improving the
whole mass of individuals and for raising the level
of the entire group; social case work on the other
hand stimulates individuals to improve the quality
of their lives, to adjust themselves more adequately
to their environment, and to transform their environments.
Social case work insists that sound
social reforms can be effected only on the basis of
first-hand experiences with the needs of individuals
who are the victims of social imperfections or their
own shortcomings. Social work with individuals
has provided a body of specific facts of first magnitude
as a foundation for measures of social amelioration
and progress; it has mirrored life which is
under the harrow of circumstances; it has portrayed
life where living conditions are harshest.</p>

<p>Applied sociology represents methods of social
attack. It furthers progress by planning for society
on the basis of past societal experiences and current
facts and tendencies. It fulfils the demands of social
telesis.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Rise of Educational Sociology</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In recent decades educational leaders have been
thinking in sociological terms. In its experimental
phases educational sociology constitutes a phase of
applied sociology. The principles of modern educational
sociology have a thousand sources.</p>

<p>Pestalozzi (1746–1827) may be considered a
forerunner of current social theories of education.
He was interested in humanity for humanity’s sake.
Like St. Francis of Assisi, he lived with the poor
in order that he might teach them to be thrifty and
worthy citizens. In his <i>Leonard and Gertrude</i>, he
described the life of the poor, and formulated an
educational procedure for educating the poor. He
was a lover of little children, of poor people, of
anyone in trouble, of all humanity. He spoke in
dignified terms of the function of a good woman,
no matter how humble her station in life. Her first
duty is to educate her children and to meet the needs
of her family. She has, also, obligations to her
neighbors and community. Others, seeing her constructive
work, will be inspired and motivated to do
likewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span></p>

<p>In opening an industrial school for the poor, Pestalozzi
recognized that the poor have the least opportunities
for development and the largest numbers
of problems to solve,—therefore they are in
the greatest need of educational advantages. He
held that all the phases of human personality should
be trained, and that there should be “a harmonious
development of all human powers.” Hence, education
is the greatest gift that anyone, rich or poor,
can receive. In urging that the child should be educated
in company with other children, that is, in
groups, he took an attitude superior to that of Rousseau,
but presaging that of Froebel.</p>

<p>Froebel (1782–1852), the founder of the kindergarten,
considered little children “as plants in a garden.”
He recognized the educative importance of
the early years of life. He perceived the possibilities
of teaching through the use of plays and games.
He understood the “interests” of little children.
His most important conception, perhaps, was his
recognition of the gregarious impulses as an effective
setting for the educative processes. While neo-Froebelians
have sometimes turned all work into
play and have neglected to train the child in doing
some things in which he is not interested at the particular
time, the utilization of the gregarious and
play impulses as vital backgrounds for education is
not unworthy. The evils in this connection are no
greater than when the Montessori method is followed,
with its emphasis upon a maximum of individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
choice.</p>

<p>In Horace Mann (1796–1859), American education
found a new social emphasis. Education in a
democracy, according to Mann, should be public and
open equally to all classes of people. Moreover, in
a democracy, education is not a mere acquisition of
knowledge; it is not concealed in college degrees as
such; it is not aristocratic. It was Mann’s contention
that education should be an actual training for
rearing worthy families, for living an unselfish social
life, for being a public spirited citizen in one’s
daily activities.</p>

<p>Mann asserted that the common school is the bulwark
of the nation. He believed that education
should encourage true religion. He inaugurated the
normal training school,—in support of his theory
of specially trained teachers. His social philosophy
is contained in a statement from his last public address:
“Be ashamed to die until you have won
a victory for humanity.”</p>

<p>During the intervening decades since the days of
Horace Mann, the social conception of education
has been assuming new practical phases. Professor
John Dewey has pointed out that all communication
is education; that the terms, common, community,
and communication, possess more than a verbal relationship.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-1" href="#Footnote_XXV-1" class="fnanchor">XXV-1</a>
Anything is educative which produces
similar emotional and intellectual dispositions, that
is, like ways of responding to stimuli. Societal life,
hence, is unusually educative. Education consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
of processes of self-development, of self-continuation,
of social continuation. These processes are
possible only on bases of common means of communication.
It is these means, as Professor C. H.
Cooley has indicated, which make even the powerful
factors of suggestion and imitation so universal.</p>

<p>It is not the environment which directly implants
certain desires in individuals.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-2" href="#Footnote_XXV-2" class="fnanchor">XXV-2</a> The environment
sets up conditions which stimulate certain ways of
acting. The child gets a real idea of a hat, not by
seeing a hat, or by being told of its uses, but by
actually using a hat. The social environment, in
other words, forms “the mental and emotional disposition
of behavior in individuals by engaging
them in activities” that arouse various impulses,
purposes, and produces certain consequences.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-3" href="#Footnote_XXV-3" class="fnanchor">XXV-3</a></p>

<p>As society becomes exceedingly complex, it is
essential that society provide a simplified social
environment through which the child may pass, in
order that he may adjust himself the more quickly
and easily to the complex societal environment. To
this end the school serves a valuable purpose. However,
in order to function best, the school must be a
replica in as many ways as possible of real society.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-4" href="#Footnote_XXV-4" class="fnanchor">XXV-4</a></p>

<p>The special social environment, namely, the
school, must simplify and arrange in an orderly
way the dispositional factors it wishes to develop in
children. It must present the existing social customs
in purified and idealized forms. It must create
a wider and better balanced environment for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
young than they would have if they were not in
school.</p>

<p>Imitation, to Dr. Dewey, is a less useful term
than many social psychologists believe. What objectively
is a process of imitation is subjectively a
process of like response to like stimuli. The term
imitation does not explain; it simply describes—objectively.
The fundamental fact that the sociological
student needs to keep in mind is that “persons
being alike in structure respond in the same
way to like stimuli.”<a id="FNanchor_XXV-5" href="#Footnote_XXV-5" class="fnanchor">XXV-5</a> This conception is similar to
ideas that Professors Giddings and Cooley have
elaborated. The societal significance of this interpretation
can be stated best in terms of social control.
The highest type of social control is that which
plans for a common mental disposition, a common
way of understanding objects, events, and acts,
common sets of socially constructive stimuli.</p>

<p>Professor Dewey argues for a school life which
fully connects theory and practice. While pragmatic,
he emphasizes the necessity for a correct
theory, but more particularly the combining of
theory and practice—in the school life itself. In
other words, anything which sets school life apart
from actual life is a disutility; it is educationally
harmful. Hence school life must include the actual
occupations, nature study, and the like. It must
relegate formal education to a secondary position.
The moral atmosphere of the schoolroom must
change from one primarily of discipline, even formal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
discipline, to one of co-operation.</p>

<p>School life, in other terms, is properly an embryonic
community life. It is the business of the school
to train each child into membership of a little community
that is a counterpart of society at large,
“saturating him with the spirit of service, and providing
him with the instruments of effective self-direction.”<a id="FNanchor_XXV-6" href="#Footnote_XXV-6" class="fnanchor">XXV-6</a>
Professor Dewey would make the
school a miniature society, fitting its members by
their daily activities in the schools for normal membership
in “a larger society which is worthy, lovely,
and harmonious.”</p>

<p>The literature on educational sociology is growing
rapidly. Within recent years several books on
educational sociology have appeared. In the list of
the authors of these works are the names of
O’Shea, Snedden, Smith, King, Clow, Betts, Dutton,
and others of equal importance.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-7" href="#Footnote_XXV-7" class="fnanchor">XXV-7</a> Professor
Walter R. Smith, for example, in applying sociological
principles to educational work, contends that
normal school graduates have been taught to look
to psychology alone for the key to sound pedagogy,
whereas sociology is perhaps an equally important
key to effective teaching. Education is not entirely
a matter of training the mind of the individual; it
is also a process of acquainting the individual with
the needs of society and of helping him to participate
in improving the quality of societary life. Dr.
Smith urges training not <em>for</em> citizenship, but training
<em>into</em> citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-8" href="#Footnote_XXV-8" class="fnanchor">XXV-8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span></p>

<p>Inasmuch as men and women live and develop
and work as members of groups, it is vital, according
to Dr. Snedden, that children be taught as integral
units of group life. It is sociology that must
determine the aims of education.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-9" href="#Footnote_XXV-9" class="fnanchor">XXV-9</a> By sociological
standards it has been proved that existing curricula
in the United States are excessively individualistic
in aim as well as in method. Their purpose has
been to encourage the individual to win against,
rather than with, his fellows. Our curricula provide
self-culture studies and self-development studies,
but few social culture and social development
studies. The former are indispensable, but if not
properly balanced by the latter they are positively
dangerous.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of individuals for collective
thinking and acting have never been taught to any
degree in the schools, and yet these responsibilities,
not only in time of war, but increasingly so in time
of peace, must be assumed widely, else democracy
itself will collapse. By training pupils in the principles
of individual success primarily, the schools
have turned out a generation of persons who are
unready to meet the new world problems that are
at hand, and who are unable to promote “constructive
programs making for international co-operation
and friendliness.”<a id="FNanchor_XXV-10" href="#Footnote_XXV-10" class="fnanchor">XXV-10</a></p>

<p>Custom, not social needs, has too often controlled
school curricula. The <i>Anabasis</i> and Caesar’s <i>Commentaries</i>,
although splendid bits of literary composition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
“are about as significant to the realities of
a nineteenth or twentieth century as bows and
arrows would be in modern warfare, or Roman galleys
in the naval contests of tomorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_XXV-11" href="#Footnote_XXV-11" class="fnanchor">XXV-11</a> The study
of forgotten tongues and antiquated fragments of
literature falls far short of training twentieth century
youths for the conscious co-operative direction
of the social forces of the future.</p>

<p>Vocational education is not all-sufficient. Youth
must be taught to be socially and morally efficient—no
less than physically and vocationally.<a id="FNanchor_XXV-12" href="#Footnote_XXV-12" class="fnanchor">XXV-12</a> In addition
to the current emphasis upon vocational education,
attention must be given to a moral education
in the schools that can produce in individuals the
moral character required to meet the needs of a
highly developed democracy.</p>

<p>Educational sociology has viewed with alarm certain
recent tendencies in vocational guidance. It
has supported heartily the plans for giving every
child an occupational training and of enabling him
to earn his own living. On the other hand, it has
deplored the idea that a vocation or earning a living
is an end in itself. It has insisted that the main
reason for teaching a boy a trade is that the boy
may have a larger opportunity for developing his
personality and for serving society.</p>

<p>Likewise, educational sociology has often looked
askance at scientific management, or the movement
for educating all workingmen to the point of highest
productive efficiency. Such a training has frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
produced a maximum increase in profits for
those who have promoted it and a minimum of increase
in wages for the workers, besides tending to
turn the latter into mere machines, instead of into
human leaders with increased capacities for enjoyment
and spiritual service.</p>

<p>The studies in all school curricula must be evaluated
in terms of social worth. For example, what
is the purpose of teaching history? Is it to give
the pupil a chronology of dates and a catalogue of
ignoble kings and bloody battles, or is it to give
the pupil the meaning of social evolution, social
progress, social inheritances, the rise of social
needs?<a id="FNanchor_XXV-13" href="#Footnote_XXV-13" class="fnanchor">XXV-13</a></p>

<p>Educational sociology holds the theory that training
for unselfish social living is as important as
training for individual pecuniary success. It is
engaged at the present time in working out techniques
for introducing every member of the public
schools to the sociological viewpoint. The names
under which such techniques appear is immaterial,
whether as community civics, American history
studies, elementary social science, or elementary
sociology. The next few decades will undoubtedly
be marked by the rapid spread of educational sociology.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Sociology of Modern Christianity</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a foregoing chapter the invaluable contribution
of the Hebrews to social thought was presented;
the attack of the prophets on social injustice
was the outstanding feature. In another chapter
the emphasis by Jesus upon love as a dynamic societal
principle was described. In the centuries which
followed the beginning of the Christian era, the
Church apotheosized beliefs, creeds, dogmas. Near
the close of the nineteenth century a renaissance of
the social teachings of Jesus occurred.</p>

<p>The trio of writers who brought forward the
social ideals of Christianity in a new, positive, and
stimulating way in the closing decades of the last
century were Washington Gladden, Josiah Strong,
and Richard T. Ely. All three of these men began
about 1885 to discuss in print the social content of
Christianity. These men had been aroused by the
apparent impotence of the Christian Church in face
of the increasing power of capitalism. While many
church leaders allowed themselves to be carried
along in the powerful arms of capitalism, there
were a few who perceived the wreck of human lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
that was often left in the wake of the capitalistic
movement. These individuals, while not blind to
the social values of capitalism, were in touch with
the laboring man, and by these contacts caught the
social need of the hour. In this social crisis they
heard the still, small voice coming down through
the centuries, even the voice of Jesus as he spoke
in behalf of the poor and outcast.</p>

<p>It was Washington Gladden who startled and
even angered the world of religious and economic
thought by protesting against the acceptance of
“tainted money.” By this term he referred to
money which had been made under a capitalistic
system at the expense of the lives of men, women,
and little children in the industrial processes. Dr.
Gladden weathered the storm of protest and gave
the capitalistic world a new concept which, while
it aroused anger, also brought introspection and a
new type of social conscience into the lives of many
Christians.</p>

<p>It was Dr. Gladden’s contention that employer
and employee ought to be friends, because they are
so closely associated. It is a very large part of the
business of the employer to maintain sympathetic
relations between himself and his employees.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-1" href="#Footnote_XXVI-1" class="fnanchor">XXVI-1</a> If
the business man will not let his fellowmen share in
his prosperity, he will become in spite of himself a
sharer in their adversity.</p>

<p>The attitude of Dr. Gladden toward the acceptance
of railway passes by the clergy attracted widespread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
attention. He came to the conclusion that
a railroad company is bound to render an equal
service to all the people; its business is not to show
special favors to the representatives of either religion
or charity.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-2" href="#Footnote_XXVI-2" class="fnanchor">XXVI-2</a> “What it has no right to give
me, I have no right to take, and for several years
I have not taken it; I pay the regular fare as all
my neighbors do or ought.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gladden urged the abolition of city slums by
governmental action. Inasmuch as slums are rife
with moral miasmas and are breeding-places of
pauperism and crime, the city has the same right to
abate such curses as to drain a morass. Moreover,
individuals ought to have no property rights “in
premises which breed death and engender vice.
When they have proved that they lack the power
to keep their property from falling into such conditions,
their property must be summarily taken
away from them.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-3" href="#Footnote_XXVI-3" class="fnanchor">XXVI-3</a></p>

<p>Without minimizing the importance of conflict as
a principle of social progress, Dr. Gladden stressed
the concept of co-operation. For example, in industrial
matters he advocated the idea of a true
trades union—“the union of employers and employed—of
guiding brains and willing hands—all
watchful of each other’s interests, seeking each
other’s welfare, working for the common good.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-4" href="#Footnote_XXVI-4" class="fnanchor">XXVI-4</a></p>

<p>In his well-known treatise on <i>Social Salvation</i>,
Dr. Gladden asserts that, in order to be soundly converted,
an individual must comprehend his social relationships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
and strive to fulfil them, as well as set
up right relationships with God.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-5" href="#Footnote_XXVI-5" class="fnanchor">XXVI-5</a> Sanctification
consists in fulfilling one’s social as well as one’s divine
privileges, and in living according to the needs
of human society as well as according to the needs
of the human soul. An individual can no more be
a Christian by himself than he can sing an oratorio
alone.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-6" href="#Footnote_XXVI-6" class="fnanchor">XXVI-6</a></p>

<p>It is no purely social gospel that Dr. Gladden
taught. He was correct in protesting against the
attitude of certain reformers who hold that changing
the environment is all-sufficient. It is possible
to go too far in removing temptations from the
pathway of men; it would be unwise to neglect the
problem of equipping men to resist temptation, and
hence to weaken the sense of moral responsibility.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-7" href="#Footnote_XXVI-7" class="fnanchor">XXVI-7</a></p>

<p>In the field of practical social reform Dr. Josiah
Strong did effective work. He also re-interpreted
the social principles of Jesus, and boldly proclaimed
the spirit of love as the cardinal principle for the
organization of human society.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-8" href="#Footnote_XXVI-8" class="fnanchor">XXVI-8</a> He indicated that
people have stressed properly the importance of <em>believing</em>
the truth, but underestimated the importance
of <em>living</em> the truth.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-9" href="#Footnote_XXVI-9" class="fnanchor">XXVI-9</a> He protested against the
tendency to separate the sacred and the secular, and
to divorce doctrine from conduct. He believed that
the prevailing religious tendency to neglect the
sacred commandment, of loving one’s neighbor as
one’s self, has led to a selfish individualism on the
part of many religious people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span></p>

<p>The contributions to social thought by Gladden
and Strong were ably supported by the social ideas
of Richard T. Ely. Professor Ely remonstrated
against the tendency of many church people to think
that they can serve God without devoting their lives
to their fellowmen.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-10" href="#Footnote_XXVI-10" class="fnanchor">XXVI-10</a> He made vivid the complaint
of American workingmen that church membership
on the part of employers and landlords does not
necessarily insure just and considerate treatment of
employees and tenants.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-11" href="#Footnote_XXVI-11" class="fnanchor">XXVI-11</a> Professor Ely insisted
that it is as holy a work “to lead a crusade against
filth, vice, and disease in slums of cities, and to seek
the abolition of the disgraceful tenement houses of
American cities, as it is to send missionaries to the
heathen.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-12" href="#Footnote_XXVI-12" class="fnanchor">XXVI-12</a></p>

<p>The pioneer work of Gladden, Strong, Ely, and
others in rejuvenating the social meaning of Christianity
in the closing years of the nineteenth century
has been carried forward in the present century
by a host of able writers. The list includes
the names of well known socio-religious thinkers
such as Peabody,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-13" href="#Footnote_XXVI-13" class="fnanchor">XXVI-13</a> Mathews,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-14" href="#Footnote_XXVI-14" class="fnanchor">XXVI-14</a> Rauschenbusch,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-15" href="#Footnote_XXVI-15" class="fnanchor">XXVI-15</a>
Batten,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-16" href="#Footnote_XXVI-16" class="fnanchor">XXVI-16</a> Ward,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-17" href="#Footnote_XXVI-17" class="fnanchor">XXVI-17</a> Atkinson,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-18" href="#Footnote_XXVI-18" class="fnanchor">XXVI-18</a> Ryan,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-19" href="#Footnote_XXVI-19" class="fnanchor">XXVI-19</a> Stelzle,<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-20" href="#Footnote_XXVI-20" class="fnanchor">XXVI-20</a> and
Taylor.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-21" href="#Footnote_XXVI-21" class="fnanchor">XXVI-21</a> Special attention will be given to the contributions
of Rauschenbusch and Ward, because
each has been a storm-center in socio-religious
matters.</p>

<p>In his <i>Christianity and the Social Crisis</i>, Professor
Rauschenbusch gave a brief history of Christianity
and its Hebrew antecedents, showing first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
that “the essential purpose of Christianity was to
transform human society into the Kingdom of God
by regenerating all human relations and reconstituting
them in accordance with the will of God.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-22" href="#Footnote_XXVI-22" class="fnanchor">XXVI-22</a> He
then raised the question, why has Christianity not
undertaken the work of social reconstruction? He
believed that if the Church were to direct its full
available force against any social wrong, probably
nothing could withstand it.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-23" href="#Footnote_XXVI-23" class="fnanchor">XXVI-23</a> Despite the fact that
Christianity has played a leading part in lifting
woman to equality and companionship with men, in
changing parental despotism to parental service, in
eliminating unnatural vice, in abolishing slavery, in
covering all lands with a network of charities, in
fostering institutions of learning, in aiding the
progress of civil liberty and social justice, in diffusing
a softening tenderness throughout human
life, in taming selfishness, and in creating a resolute
sense of duty, it has not yet undertaken a reconstruction
of society on a Christian basis.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-24" href="#Footnote_XXVI-24" class="fnanchor">XXVI-24</a> It has
been engaged in suppressing some of the most glaring
evils in the social system of the time.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-25" href="#Footnote_XXVI-25" class="fnanchor">XXVI-25</a></p>

<p>Dr. Rauschenbusch pointed out several historical
factors which have prevented Christianity from
entering upon a program of reconstructing society,
many of which no longer obtain.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-26" href="#Footnote_XXVI-26" class="fnanchor">XXVI-26</a> These hindering
factors have been: (1) the moral resentment of the
classes whose interests are endangered by a moral
campaign; (2) the belief in the immediate return
of Christ, which precluded a long outlook; (3) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
primitive attitude of fear and distrust toward the
state; (4) the other-worldliness of Christian desire;
(5) the ascetic and monastic ideals; (6) ceremonialism;
(7) dogmatism; (8) the monarchial organization
of the church; (9) an absence of the intellectual
prerequisites for social reconstruction.
To the extent that Christianity is no longer hampered
by these characteristics it is ready to undertake
the task of making over society.</p>

<p>The main danger in the present crisis which demands
the attention of social Christianity was
found by Professor Rauschenbusch in the autocratic,
unjust phases of capitalism, with its somewhat
undemocratic wage system. To this expression
of autocracy there is a three-fold class reaction.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-27" href="#Footnote_XXVI-27" class="fnanchor">XXVI-27</a>
First, there are those classes which are in
practical control of wealth; they have no reformatory
program; they are anxious to maintain the
present social order intact. Second, there are the
middle social classes, which, sharing partially in the
advantages of the present social adjustment, are
also chafing under social grievances which their
ideals do not allow them to attack vigorously; they
want reform work by peaceful and gradual methods.
Third, there are the disinherited classes, which
see a widening chasm between themselves and the
wealthy, a chasm that “only a revolutionary lift can
carry them across.” It is around the condition and
attitudes of the masses that the social crisis revolves.
This social attitude is like a tank of gasoline,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
which by a single explosion will blow a car
sky-high, or which, by a series of little explosions
will push a car to the top of a mountain.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-28" href="#Footnote_XXVI-28" class="fnanchor">XXVI-28</a> Which
process does Christianity wish to further? If the
latter, then Christianity must socialize first the attitude
of the classes of wealth and social power. Unfortunately,
wealth often grows stronger than the
man who owns it; it may own him and rob him of
his moral and spiritual freedom.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-29" href="#Footnote_XXVI-29" class="fnanchor">XXVI-29</a> Can Christianity
dissolve this dilemma?</p>

<p>The principle that a Christian should seek an
ascetic departure from the world of life and work
is no longer acceptable. He has two other possibilities.
He can either condemn the world and try to
improve it, or tolerate it and gradually be conformed
to it.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-30" href="#Footnote_XXVI-30" class="fnanchor">XXVI-30</a> By these sharply drawn alternatives,
Professor Rauschenbusch awoke the Christian
world. While many Christians did not believe that
the situation was as crucial as thus depicted, they
nevertheless were jarred from a state of moral
lethargy.</p>

<p>As a pastor for eleven years among the working
people of New York City, Dr. Rauschenbusch
learned to understand the heart throbs and yearnings
of the masses, and dedicated his life through
Christian service to easing the pressure upon the
working classes and to increasing the forces that
bear them up. He saw the solution of the social
problem in a Christian socialism that would destroy
the autocracy of wealth and establish a democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
form of industrial relationships. He believed in
the social or public ownership of the natural resources
of the earth. “It is preposterous to think
that an individual or a corporation can have absolute
ownership in a vein of coal or copper. A mining
company owns the holes in the ground, for it
made the holes; it does not own the coal; for it did
not make the coal. The coal is the gift of God and
belongs to the people.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-31" href="#Footnote_XXVI-31" class="fnanchor">XXVI-31</a></p>

<p>Another difficulty is found in the fact that business
methods and the principles of Christianity have
always been at strife.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-32" href="#Footnote_XXVI-32" class="fnanchor">XXVI-32</a> Individuals are struggling
to get the better of their fellows. This tendency
has been institutionalized in the form of business
enterprise. Private persons have been permitted
“to put their thumbs where they can constrict the
life blood of the nation at will.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-33" href="#Footnote_XXVI-33" class="fnanchor">XXVI-33</a> Christianity, on
the other hand, lauds the principle of unselfish service,
and of ranking the individual as the greatest
who gives most. Christianity is awakening to its
gigantic task of stopping the nation on “its headlong
ride on the road of covetousness.”</p>

<p>It is in this connection that Professor Rauschenbusch
has made famous the phrase, “Christianizing
the social order.” This term means “bringing the
social order into harmony with the ethical convictions
which are identified with Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-35" href="#Footnote_XXVI-35" class="fnanchor">XXVI-35</a> Such a
program involves attacking “the last intrenchment
of autocracy,” namely, in business,—and Christianizing
business. The struggle is already on. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
many of the phases of the conflict, capitalism is
swallowing up Christianity. The church becomes
traditional, narrowly ecclesiastical, dogmatic, opposing
science and democracy. Where capitalism
is strongest, the churches as virile social forces are
weakest.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-34" href="#Footnote_XXVI-34" class="fnanchor">XXVI-34</a></p>

<p>In reply to the often repeated charge that socialized
Christianity is no Christianity at all, Professor
Rauschenbusch shows that personal religion, instead
of being defeated by a socialized religion, will gain
strength and be able to present a much stronger
appeal than it now does. The advocate of the social
teachings of Jesus is not attacking personal religion,
but rather endeavoring to give personal religion a
new dynamic, especially in those phases of modern
life where personal religion has lost most of its
appeal. The opponents of social Christianity cannot
afford to neglect the fact that the often one-sided,
mechanical, and superficial gospel and methods
of evangelism have created a religious apathy,
if not a definite reaction against religion.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-36" href="#Footnote_XXVI-36" class="fnanchor">XXVI-36</a> It is
blind foolishness to try to fence out the new social
spirit from Christianity instead of letting it fuse
with the older religious faith and “create a new total
that will be completer and more Christian than the
old religious individualism at its best.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-37" href="#Footnote_XXVI-37" class="fnanchor">XXVI-37</a></p>

<p>Dr. Rauschenbusch insisted that there must be a
Christianizing of international relations, that individuals
must be taught to see the sinfulness of the
present social order, and that the popular conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
of God must be democratized.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-39" href="#Footnote_XXVI-39" class="fnanchor">XXVI-39</a> He reinterpreted
the organic unity of human society,—asserting
that when one man sins, other men suffer; and
that when one class sins, other classes bear a part
of the suffering.</p>

<p>In 1908, the Federal Council of the Churches of
Christ in America was organized at Philadelphia.
The Council adopted with slight modifications the
resolutions which some months earlier had been
accepted by the General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church (North), and which Rev.
Harry F. Ward and others had drawn up.</p>

<p>This Bill of Rights, as the Resolutions have been
called, imposed upon the members of the more than
thirty Protestant denominations the duty of obtaining
industrial justice for the cause of labor. It
spoke for (1) the principle of arbitration in industrial
dissensions, (2) the adequate protection of
workers in hazardous trades, (3) the abolition of
child labor, (4) the safeguarding of physical and
moral health of women in industry, (5) the suppression
of the “sweating system,” (6) the reduction
of the hours of labor to the lowest practicable
point, (7) a living wage in all industries, (8) one
day of rest in seven for all workers, (9) the most
equitable division of the products of industry that
can ultimately be devised, (10) suitable provisions
for old age or disability of workers, and (11) the
abatement of poverty.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Federal Council of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
Churches of Christ in America at a special meeting
held at Cleveland, Ohio, May 6–8, 1919, the foregoing
platform was re-affirmed; and in addition, as
a means of meeting the needs of the reconstruction
days following the World War, the following notable
resolutions were adopted. The Council declared
not only that labor is entitled to an equitable
share in the profits of industry, but took the new
step of expressing the belief that labor is entitled
also to an equitable share in the management of industry.
“The sharing of shop control and management
is an inevitable step” in the attainment of an
ordered and constructive democracy in industry.
The Council asserted that the first charge upon industry
should be wages sufficient to support an
American standard of living.</p>

<p>In 1919, the Committee on Special War Activities
of the National Catholic War Council published
a brief but important document on social reconstruction.
In this pamphlet the defects of the capitalistic
system of industry are declared to be:
“Enormous inefficiency and waste in the production
and distribution of commodities; insufficient incomes
for the great majority of wage-earners; and
unnecessarily large incomes for a small minority
of privileged capitalists.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-40" href="#Footnote_XXVI-40" class="fnanchor">XXVI-40</a> The Committee urged
that employees shall exercise a reasonable share in
the management of industrial enterprises, and that
the State should inaugurate comprehensive provisions
for health insurance and old age insurance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
It recognized that the true line of progress is in the
direction of co-operative production and of co-partnership
arrangements. “In the former, the workers
own and manage the industries themselves; in
the latter, they own a substantial part of the corporate
stock and exercise a reasonable share in the
management.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-41" href="#Footnote_XXVI-41" class="fnanchor">XXVI-41</a> The Catholic pronunciamento demands
that the spirit of both labor and capital be
reformed. The laborer must give up the desire of
a maximum of return for a minimum of service;
he must remember that he owes society an honest
day’s work for a fair wage. On the other hand the
capitalist must learn that wealth is not possession
but stewardship, and that “profit-making is not the
basic justification of business enterprise.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-42" href="#Footnote_XXVI-42" class="fnanchor">XXVI-42</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch as the Rev. Harry F. Ward has written
more extensively on social Christianity than
any other person, save Rauschenbusch, and has
created widespread and heart-searching discussions,
his contributions to socio-religious thought
will be considered next. Dr. Ward does not believe
in social service as a bait for drawing people into
the church. He objects to bribing people in order
to get them into an evangelistic meeting. To him
social service is a natural phase of religion, expressing
itself freely and without sinuous designs. In
his estimation, soup kitchens are not to be established
as a means of enticing the laboring man inside
the church walls, but as an unselfish expression
of the Christian’s desire to be true to the Christ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
spirit. Social service is not a selfish program, on
the part of the church, for increasing its membership.
It is as natural to Christianity as personal
evangelism, and equally intrinsic and vital. It has
won more than national recognition. While it is
radical in the eyes of the conservative, it contains
an analysis of social conditions that many of its
critics have not appreciated. It breathes a sincerity
and a straightforwardness that compels the fair-minded
reader to give heed.</p>

<p>Slavery was rejected as the economic basis of
civilization, and monarchy has recently been rejected
as the political basis. In each instance the
world came to a junction where idealistic impulse
overthrew entrenched power. It is Dr. Ward’s
contention that the world is now reaching a similar
junction point, a point where idealistic impulse will
dethrone the autocracy in capitalism. The idealistic
impulse, to which reference has been made in the
foregoing lines, is germinal in the teachings of
Jesus.</p>

<p>With prophetic vision, more organized than the
vision of Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, but equally sincere,
and fearless, Dr. Ward points out the principles of
the new social order which he believes are almost
upon the world. He then describes the various
factors which are struggling each in its own way
to inaugurate the new order.</p>

<p>The five principles of the new social order are
equality, universal service, efficiency, the supremacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
of personality, and solidarity. (1) Equality is the
old word which won attention in the American and
French Revolutions. It grew out of the theory of
natural rights which was discussed in <a href="#Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a>.
The American emphasis on the principle of equality
is shown in the admiration that is accorded the
achievements of energy and toil, in the common
struggle for more wealth and luxury, in foreign
missionary activities, in the rise of the democratic
conscience and the idealistic impulses of the people.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the principle of equality is
being violated when, instead of trying to remove
the natural inequalities among folks, “we increase
them by giving special privileges to the strong as
the reward of their strength.” The United States
is at the crossroads. One highway is characterized
by luxury and extravagance on one side, and by
poverty and slavery on the other; it leads to revolutionary
attempts on the part of the masses to overthrow
the privileged classes. It ends in national
decadence. The second highway is characterized
by justice. Those in economic authority are willing
to grant representation to labor in the management
of industry and to further the rise of the co-operative
spirit. They are willing to sacrifice their own
special privileges for the sake of the welfare of the
disinherited.</p>

<p>The intellectuals of the middle class hold vast
power. In crises, they usually join the privileged
classes rather than the masses; and hence, their influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
often swings to the side of injustice.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-43" href="#Footnote_XXVI-43" class="fnanchor">XXVI-43</a></p>

<p>(2) Universal service is the principle of equal
obligation. Equal rights, by itself, may mean equal
rights to cheat, to exploit. It needs to be checked
by its complement of equal obligation. During the
World War there was a frequent demonstration of
the principle of universal service. “We are engaged
in helping the boys at the front” became the
slogan. At the front as well as in the home towns
and cities, wealthy and poor, capital and labor
served together. The end of the War gave prominence
to this question: Will the universal service
idea spread or will it be discarded? Will industry
go back to the unashamed pursuit of private gain?<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-44" href="#Footnote_XXVI-44" class="fnanchor">XXVI-44</a></p>

<p>Dr. Ward makes a careful distinction between
the service of democratic mutual helpfulness and
the service of a governing class, no matter how
excellent.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-45" href="#Footnote_XXVI-45" class="fnanchor">XXVI-45</a> It is a low type of service which grants
Christmas dinners to the poor with the result that
the poor are thereby made contented with their lot
in life.</p>

<p>(3) Efficiency is a term which is the product of
the mechanical era, which originated in the business
world, and which is now being applied to all phases
of social organization.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-46" href="#Footnote_XXVI-46" class="fnanchor">XXVI-46</a> Its aim is perfection in
social mechanics. Social efficiency includes not only
social engineering but social knowledge, social philosophy,
social ethics, and social religion. Evidences
of social inefficiency are common; for example, the
failure to use and apply the social knowledge that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
we have, and the loss of energy through an over-emphasis
on competition. Democracy will never
be able to succeed merely because of its splendid
ethical ideals.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-47" href="#Footnote_XXVI-47" class="fnanchor">XXVI-47</a> The need is for an efficiency in
government that is scientific and not simply a business
efficiency.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-48" href="#Footnote_XXVI-48" class="fnanchor">XXVI-48</a> Scientific efficiency includes “the
spirit of service to the common interest by which
alone democracy can live.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-49" href="#Footnote_XXVI-49" class="fnanchor">XXVI-49</a></p>

<p>(4) The supremacy of personality is a principle
of life that conflicts today with the current emphasis
on economic efficiency. It is because the
latter is so often reckless of human values that the
new social order will stress the development of
things of the spirit rather than material goods;
even business must practice this ideal. The World
War raised the estimate which the common people
put on their own lives; but the ultimate result will
depend on whether or not people took part in the
war voluntarily and conscious of high moral purposes,
and whether or not the peace which follows
shall bring a new world organization that conserves
all the advances in human living that have thus far
been made.</p>

<p>Institutions possess an inherent fallibility. They
tend to become mechanical and repressive, even
those dedicated to high purposes, such as institutions
of democracy, of education, and of religion.
The supreme object of any social institution and
organization, no matter in what field it may exist,
should be the increase of personality.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-50" href="#Footnote_XXVI-50" class="fnanchor">XXVI-50</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span></p>

<p>(5) The new social order will be governed by a
sense of solidarity, that is, by a community of feeling
and thought which arises when individuals
associate together in working for a common end.
World solidarity will come when all peoples learn
to work together for public welfare, and subordinate
all selfish desires to this end. Christianity
is moving in this direction when it advances the
concept of “comradeship of all men with each other
and with the Great Companion,” when it gradually
unfolds the idea of a unified world life, when it
applies its doctrines of brotherhood of man to the
relations of the employer and employee or to the
relations of white and black races, when it seeks
the democratic solidarity of the human race rather
than the imperialistic solidarity of an overhead
religious control, when it endeavors to spread love
and faith, rather than to spread dogmas and promote
organizations.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-51" href="#Footnote_XXVI-51" class="fnanchor">XXVI-51</a> Class cleavage, nationalism
as distinct from nationality, race prejudice, ignorance,
and selfishness are the main opponents of the
world brotherhood principle.</p>

<p>Dr. Ward, having defined what he considers the
chief principles that will govern the new social
order, proceeds to measure current movements by
certain standards. He reviews the declarations of
the British Labor Party, the Russian Soviet Republic,
the League of Nations, and the labor movements
in the United States. These tendencies are
all expressions of a more or less blind desire for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
justice. In all countries of the world the masses
are restless, stirring, and experiencing a keen sense
of injustice. Their leaders are struggling, unscientifically
as a rule, toward the light of a new
day of democracy. The trend which this struggle
takes depends on the given social environment and
the attitude of the persons in authority. If undue
repression and autocracy are exercised for a long
period of time, as in Russia under the Czars, revolution
is the only means of escape open to the
masses. Schooled for a long time under the lash
of autocracy, when they themselves come into control,
they will use the only means of control that
they know, the lash of autocracy.</p>

<p>The British Labor Party is moving in the direction
of guild socialism, which includes the organization
of industry into large units, in charge of the
workers and relatively free from the rule of the
politicians. The national government is to have a
general oversight over the large industrial units.
As immediate steps in this direction, the Labor
Party demands the nationalization of the railroads,
mines, and of the production of electric power.
Municipalities participate in the common ownership
program. The method of transformation is to
be gradual, largely based on political action.</p>

<p>In regard to the League of Nations Covenant,
which was agreed upon in Paris in 1919, Dr. Ward
takes a negative attitude. Although he believes
firmly in an organization of good will, in international<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
friendship and in world solidarity upon
democratic bases, he asserts stoutly that the Paris
Covenant is “a symbol of the sacred right of private
property,”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-52" href="#Footnote_XXVI-52" class="fnanchor">XXVI-52</a> that it provided for an international
organization of capitalism with all the force of
powerful national governments behind it, that it
represented a series of compromises between nationally
selfish units, that it was an expression of
the wishes of the rulers of the democratic states
who are essentially of “the same moral caliber as
the ruling class of imperialistic militarism, and
bear a similar sinister relationship to the future
welfare of the common folk.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-53" href="#Footnote_XXVI-53" class="fnanchor">XXVI-53</a></p>

<p>The weakness of Dr. Ward’s treatment of the
programs for the new social order is that it discusses
almost entirely programs, platforms, ideals,
without considerating the relations between the programs
and the actual practices of the various organizations.
In contrasting the best phases, for example,
of the British Labor Party with the worst
phases of capitalism, an incomplete picture is given.
However, this weakness in method need not obscure
the strength of thought which Dr. Ward displays.
Some of the most thought-provoking deductions
are:</p>

<p>1. That individualistic Christianity is losing
ground.</p>

<p>2. That the middle class is becoming a class of
privilege.</p>

<p>3. That the intellectuals of the middle class,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
while keenly aware of the evils in the capitalistic
system, are so much indebted to that system that
they would consider themselves ingrates if they
spoke out against it, or they are simply afraid to
speak out.</p>

<p>4. That jails and machine guns will not stop the
laboring classes in appealing for a democratic reorganization
of industry, but will rather hasten
revolutions, with resultant dictatorships of the proletariat.</p>

<p>5. That capitalism is passing, as it is bound to
do, because it is organized selfishness—its fundamental
principle is wrong.</p>

<p>6. That political democracy is fighting for its
life today, being attacked on the one flank by economic
imperialism and on the other by the dictatorship
of the proletariat.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-54" href="#Footnote_XXVI-54" class="fnanchor">XXVI-54</a></p>

<p>7. That unless the struggle can be ended by a
process of reason and orderly progress, the world
is doomed to devastation by universal conflict.</p>

<p>8. That the goal of social development is, in
broad terms, “a fraternal world community, the
great loving family of mankind, knit together by
common needs but most of all by loyalty to common
ideals, and by the power of its common love efficiently
directing and controlling its common life.”<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-55" href="#Footnote_XXVI-55" class="fnanchor">XXVI-55</a></p>

<p>An important question arises: How shall the
social teachings of Jesus become widely taught?
Evangelistic Christianity, with its personal emphasis,
cannot be expected adequately to carry the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
social message. Preachers, theologically trained,
are bound to give the social phases of Christianity
a secondary place. In recent years, however, a
movement known as religious education has been
acquiring momentum. Moreover, a social theory
of religious education has been formulated. In this
connection, Dr. George Albert Coe has perhaps
done the most significant work. Our life, Dr. Coe
believes, gets its largest meaning not from the fact
of individual self-consciousness alone, but from the
equally important fact that life is social.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-56" href="#Footnote_XXVI-56" class="fnanchor">XXVI-56</a> Without
a belief in social consciousness, an endless existence
after death, in terms of self-consciousness primarily,
would be meaningless and probably valueless.
Religion must solve the problem of establishing
a Kingdom of Heaven on earth, and also train
its votaries for a societal life in Heaven. The
latter problem will be met easily when the former
is solved. It is well illustrated by the young Christian
lady from Virginia who asked: Won’t there
have to be a separate Heaven for Negroes, since
we hate them so here? In other words, will there
not have to be a thousand or a million Heavens in
order to accommodate happily all the antagonistic
Christian groups now on earth? How can the
Protestant Ulstermen and Catholic Irishmen live
together lovingly in Heaven? The problem goes
back to solving the social implications of Christianity
in earthly relationships.</p>

<p>The social aims of Christian education, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
to Dr. Coe, are as follows: (1) Social welfare, or
the control of the non-human environment in the
interest of human life. (2) Social justice, or the
inauguration of fair play in all the dealings of
every individual, no matter how strong and shrewd,
with every other individual, no matter how weak
and ignorant. (3) A world society or the promotion
of a code of conduct that leads to “the integration
of all peoples into a single, democratically governed
mankind.” Nationalism must melt into a
larger regard for human beings; and that which is
“a climactic expression of the selfishness, that is to
say the injustice that is organized in our legal systems
and our national sovereignties,” must be revealed
to all, even in the Sunday schools.<a id="FNanchor_XXVI-57" href="#Footnote_XXVI-57" class="fnanchor">XXVI-57</a></p>

<p>The implications of a sound social theory of religious
education are met by the religious doctrine
of personal fellowship between God and man, and
between man and man; by a reorganization of the
church as a religious institution in a way which
shall put religious education on as scientific a basis
as the ordinary day school education; and by training
the church school pupils in the principles of
social justice, co-operation, and love, as well as in
matters pertaining to personal salvation.</p>

<p>Another current development is the religious social
service director. For some time the religious
education director has been a recognized force in
church work. The social service director in church
life is coming into the foreground, bearing the responsibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
of working out social welfare programs
for the church services, directing the training of
the membership in volunteer social work, inaugurating
religious social surveys, in fact, carrying the
social message of the church into all the church
activities.</p>

<p>The social service activities of the church have
often been used as a net for catching the churchless.
Social service as a bribe, however, will
fail. Genuine religious social service is that which
emanates naturally and easily from the lives of the
church members and of the church itself, asking no
pay and possessing no sinuous ends. The church
that inaugurates a social program for building up
the family life, the play life, the moral life, the economic
life, as well as the religious life, in the community
in which it is located, most truly represents
a socialized church. The church, however, that uses
its social welfare program merely in order to build
itself up, fails to understand the social calling as a
religious institution.</p>

<p>The social thought of the Hebrews revolved
about the idea of social justice; of Jesus, about
the concept of active love; and of modern Christianity,
at its best, about an unselfish social program
for bringing about a just, co-operative, and harmonious
life, ranging in its operation from the individual
in his family and local community life to
the individual as a functioning unit in a new world
society.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Methods of Sociological Investigation</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>In any line of thought or endeavor a correct
method of procedure is all-important. Inaccurate
theories of procedure have wrecked nations, hindered
civilization for centuries at a time, and
flooded the world with negative and harmful ideas.
It will be worth while, therefore, to consider the
methods by which sociology has advanced.</p>

<p>The ancient makers of social proverbs crystallized
what they had individually observed many
times to be true, or what they had heard repeated
on many occasions as being true. Such methods
were based on observation and generalization, carelessly
used. Moreover, the data at the command
of the makers of social proverbs were very limited.</p>

<p>The Hebrew prophets, fired by exalted ideas concerning
the nature of Jehovah, insisted upon a practical
application of these ideas to the daily life of
the people of their time. When they perceived that
the actions and living conditions of the people fell
far below the implications of the pattern-ideas for
which the name of Jehovah stood, they vehemently
proclaimed definite social ideals, and condemned all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
who hindered the realization of these ideals. This
method of creating social thought is noteworthy because
of the religious dynamic behind it, and because
of the social pattern-ideas which it produced.</p>

<p>Plato and Aristotle were pioneer social philosophers
who took cosmic views of life. One followed
the method of abstract reasoning and centered his
thought in a world of Ideas; the other viewed life
pragmatically, employing a method of empirical
tests. While sociology will always have a place for
methods which interpret the daily facts of individual
and social experience in their relationships
to the whole human society and to the universe, it
will insist that as large a body of societary data as
possible be gathered together before philosophic
sociology speaks positively.</p>

<p>In the teachings of Jesus a rare insight to human
nature is manifested. Jesus studied individuals as
individuals and, perceiving their selfish natures,
proclaimed a remedy in an inner transformation
through consecration to objective factors, such as
persons and ideals. Jesus was peculiarly happy in
his method of moving among all classes of people,
of studying their needs, and of testing in practice
his social principles. While his acquaintance with
human life was limited to small groups of one race,
he sought universal as well as particular human
tendencies. His method included an absolutely unselfish
spirit, a search for the truth, a broad viewpoint—all
of which are thoroughly scientific.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span></p>

<p>The <i>Utopia</i> of Sir Thomas More, preceded to be
sure by Plato’s <i>Republic</i>, introduced another social
thought method. The utopian formula consists in
setting forth a set of ideals which presumably are
distinctly in advance of current standards. The
method of arriving at utopian ideas is largely
through the use of the imagination. Standards are
postulated so far in advance of current conditions
as to make them of little value. Utopian social
thought, however, does have some scientific merit.
The imagination may be used in revealing reality
to otherwise blind individuals. A utopian thought
may startle a selfish individual out of a part of his
selfishness. A utopian idea possesses the power
which is inherent in indirect suggestion; it may
arouse without antagonizing.</p>

<p>In the approach to the social question through
an analysis of the natural rights of the individual,
the seventeenth and eighteenth social writers fell
into a deductive and a priori procedure which led
them far astray. Like the theory of individual
rights, the correlative doctrine of the social contract
contained more error than truth.</p>

<p>The method of positivism, ordinarily connected
with the writings of Comte, essayed a scientific approach
to the social question. It insisted upon accuracy,
induction, and a right emphasis upon sequence
and co-existence. But positivism, even in the
hands of its exponents, became deductive and philosophic.
It promised well scientifically, but fell into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
nearly all the errors which it condemned. It was,
however, a factor in producing the nineteenth century
humanitarianism.</p>

<p>The organic analogy method of studying human
society attracted widespread attention, appealed
strongly to the imagination even of scholars, but
resulted in findings of negligible value. The parallelisms
between an organism and society proved to
be scientifically valueless, except as they revealed
some of the connections between organic volution
and social evolution. They created a considerable
vocabulary of bio-social terminology which has been
more of a hindrance than a help in social thinking.</p>

<p>The psychical approach to the study of societary
life, introduced by Lester F. Ward, and made scientific
by the findings of inductive and behavioristic
psychology, has proved thus far to be the best
method of understanding the social process and of
arriving at a statement of sociological laws. This
method has revealed human life as a series of social
conflicts and co-operations, and of forms of social
control designed to regulate individuals for selfish
and unselfish group purposes. An explanation of
the more important phases of the psychical methodology
has been presented in several chapters of this
volume.</p>

<p>The individual rights doctrine, the social contract
theories, the concept of positivism, and the
organic analogies belong to the unscientific age in
sociological methodology. In the main these sets of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
social theories were philosophic, deductive, a priori,
and argumentative. They were based chiefly on
opinions, positivism alone leaning to observation
and induction but failing to live up to its promises.
On the other hand, recent decades have been
marked by the rise of scientific methods in sociology,
attention has been centered on the social
process, and particularly on the psychical processes
of which the social process is an elaboration. Although
he possessed an entirely inadequate knowledge
of psychology, Lester F. Ward laid the foundations
of modern sociology when he insisted that
society is a psychical affair, capable of mastering
itself. As a result of this contribution to method,
not by a psychologist but by a paleontologist, social
thought moved forward into the field of scientific
sociology.</p>

<p>There are many writers who would class Ward
with the pre-scientific contributors to sociological
thought. His methods, it is true, were largely deductive;
his psychology was seriously faulty; his
philosophy was inefficient. Nevertheless, he pointed
the way for sociologists so clearly that in this
treatise his work has been considered as giving the
trend to recent sociology, rather than as being the
last word of discredited types of social thought.</p>

<p>Then there are other types of sociological methodology
of which mention should be made, notably,
the statistical, and the classificatory procedures.
The statistical approach had its origin in the early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
census. There are evidences that rulers and kings,
at least two or three millenniums before Christ, had
enumerations of their subjects made. In connection
with poor-law administration, people as early
as the Roman Era were counted. But it was not
until the eighteenth century that statistics became
scientific, with statistical laws drawn from a study
of tabulated facts. Quetelet gives 1820 as the birth
year of statistical science. It was Frederick William
I of Prussia who is reported to have had
an enumeration made of occupational facts; and
Frederick the Great, with having established a system
for making regular statistical studies of population.
It is said that early in the eighteenth century
the University of Jena began to offer courses
in statistics.</p>

<p>In England, in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, Captain John Graunt is credited with applying
methods of counting, measurement, and induction
to the births and deaths in London. His
studies were referred to as political arithmetic, and
were a forerunner of the current investigations in
vital statistics. Malthus made use of statistical
methods in his work (1798) on population changes.</p>

<p>Quetelet (1796–1874) is usually considered the
founder of statistical science. He not only applied
the method of counting to the study of the members
of human society (the census method in its
common form), but he tried to get at the problem
of causation, and to indicate rules of procedure for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
making causal studies in statistics. Although this
celebrated Belgian statistician tabulated and analyzed
facts ranging from the astronomical to the
societary fields, his ideas can be mentioned here only
so far as they contribute to the subject of social
thought. Quetelet pointed out certain of the pitfalls
in the way of gathering accurate data. He improved
the methods of census taking, and undertook
the difficult tasks that are involved in qualitative
human studies.</p>

<p>Among the results of Quetelet’s work, the concept
of “the average man” is well known. Quetelet
defined the law of averages and described types, especially
the average individual. Although it is very
important and useful to know about the “average
man,” the term is practically fictitious, since no one
even in a large group exactly fits the description.
All individuals are either “above” or “below” the
average.</p>

<p>The contributions of Quetelet in the field of social
statistics were admirably supplemented by the
achievements of Le Play (1806–1882). This French
sociologist and mining engineer applied the methods
of physical science to social science. He insisted
upon observation of data and the use of induction
in making generalizations. His method is illustrated
by his studies in family budgets. In order
to secure accurate data he lived with individual
families, studying at first-hand the conditions by
which they made a livelihood. Le Play opposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laissez-faire</i> theories and urged programs of reform
through the journal which he founded, namely, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La
Reforme Sociale</i>. He rejected socialism, and advocated
the method of conciliation and sympathy for
effecting agreements among employers and employees.</p>

<p>Similar methods were evolved by Engels and
Bücher, German investigators. Engels’ studies of
family budgets led him to draw certain average observations.
These “averages” are known as Engels’
laws, for example: (1) The smaller the income,
the larger the percentage of expenditure for food.
(2) The percentage of expenditure for clothing,
and for lodging or rent, varies directly with the income.
(3) The larger the income, the larger the
percentage of expenditures for sundries (including
luxuries).</p>

<p>The statistical method has been carried forward
by a large number of social investigators. With
averages, modes, and medians, it is now possible to
make accurate quantitative studies. Current statistical
methods include the use of index numbers, frequency
tables, discrete series, deviations, skewness,
correlations. Statistics has thrown a flood of light
upon important phases of societary life, such as the
economic, where wage scales and price levels are
significant concepts. Statistics has been widely utilized
in the study of crime and poverty. The various
methods of graphic presentations are valuable
in interpreting tables of statistical data to the lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
mind.</p>

<p>Statistical methods can be used, however, to
prove almost anything. The ordinary individual is
helpless when statistical methods are treated unscrupulously.
On the other hand, it is probably
true that social thought will become increasingly
accurate by the judicious use of statistical studies.</p>

<p>A recent development, closely related to statistical
science, is the social survey. Beginning with
the Pittsburg Survey in 1907–1908, the social survey
method has been widely adopted in the United
States. Its use has been applied to inventories of
a specific community, such as a rural district or a
small number of city blocks. There is the specific
survey of a given social problem, such as housing
or poverty. Then there is the survey of an entire
industry or a school system.</p>

<p>The social survey is one of the most important
sources today of sound social thinking. By it, large
quantities of social facts are being collected. Urban
and rural surveys, specific and general surveys
alike, are affording the best bases at the present
time for inductive social thinking. Some of these
results have been indicated in a preceding chapter
upon the contributions of applied sociology.</p>

<p>The nature of the classificatory method has already
been indicated in this treatise. The Greeks
classified the various fields of knowledge under
three heads: physics, ethics, and politics. Francis
Bacon classified knowledge according to his understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
of mental operations. He divided mental
processes into three, namely, feeling, memory, reasoning;
and made a corresponding division of
knowledge into art, history, and science. Auguste
Comte classified the social elements into four
groups: the industrial, the esthetic, the scientific,
and the philosophical (previsional). His hierarchal
classification of the sciences into mathematics, astronomy,
physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology
has been discussed in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>Guillaume de Greef may be considered the best
exponent of the classificatory method. De Greef
accepted Comte’s hierarchy of the sciences with its
basic principles of decreasing generality and increasing
dependence of parts, assented to Spencer’s
evolutionary dictum of increasing coherence and
heterogeneity, and added his own concept of volitional
contractualism.</p>

<p>De Greef argued that social progress is characterized
by an increasing degree of volitional activity
and freedom. This volitionalism is the basis of
rational social control. The telic factors, however,
are not well developed by de Greef. His social
thought rests upon a certain logical but inaccurate
classification of the social elements.</p>

<p>The basis of this classification is increasing volitionalism
and particularism. De Greef gives the
following classification: economic, industrial, genetic,
artistic, scientific, moral, juridical, and political.
In holding that the economic elements in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
society represent the least volitionalism, and the political
the most volitional activity, with graded degrees
of volitional activities represented by the
intermediate factors, the weakness of de Greef’s
analysis becomes evident. While an improvement
over Comte’s classification and superior to Spencer’s
mechanistic order, de Greef’s contribution possesses
only a relative degree of logical merit. It is far
from being objectively correct, and is indicative of
the difficulties in the way of classifying social elements
in an evolutionary or filial order. There is
no doubt but that any classification of merit would
have to be arranged according to some correlative
plan, which would serve the purposes of an exhibit
but would not be of much scientific value. Moreover,
the classifications that are most useful are
those classifications of societary forces; these are
psychical in nature and have been treated in foregoing
chapters.</p>

<p>De Greef perceived the importance of the principle
of socialization. He emphasized the importance
of a “we” feeling in societary life. His social
unit is the primitive family. In the evolution from
the primitive family and state, the evidence of progress
is the degree of “togetherness” that has been
developed. De Greef advanced the idea that there
is an increasing degree of contractualism and hence
of freedom in society. De Greef’s work may be
taken as the best attempt to carry Comte’s classification
of the sciences to a logical conclusion by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
furnishing a classification of the elements which
function in the field of the “highest” science of all,
namely, sociology.</p>

<p>At this point and in concluding, the methodology
of Albion W. Small will be considered. Professor
Small’s other contributions to sociological thought
have been indicated at the proper places in earlier
chapters. The correct method for pursuing sociological
analyses is to treat human society in terms
of process. The main current in all sound sociological
study is the social process. The significant
test of progress in this social process is achievement.<a id="FNanchor_XXVII-2" href="#Footnote_XXVII-2" class="fnanchor">XXVII-2</a>
According to Professor Small’s classification,
there are six main phases of social progress,
namely:</p>

<p>1. Achievement in promoting health,</p>

<p>2. Achievement in harmonizing human relations,</p>

<p>3. Achievement in producing wealth,</p>

<p>4. Achievement in discovery and spread of knowledge,</p>

<p>5. Achievement in the fine arts,</p>

<p>6. Achievement in religion.</p>

<p>These grand divisions are the expressions of certain
interests<a id="FNanchor_XXVII-3" href="#Footnote_XXVII-3" class="fnanchor">XXVII-3</a> that human beings possess: (1)
health interests, (2) wealth interests, (3) sociability
interests, (4) knowledge interests, (5) esthetic
interests, and (6) rightness interests. As a result
of the operation of these interests, social problems
are produced. Sociology is “the science of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
interests and their workings under all conditions.”</p>

<p>In this classification human interests serve as the
main key forces to an understanding of the social
process. Upon psychological examination, however,
the interests are found to be bafflingly complex. The
psychologist has not given a satisfactory description
of interests. And yet it is clear that what people
are interested in is a fair criterion of the direction
which their evolution will take. Furthermore,
the changes in the interests of people are fundamental
in telic social progress. With a correlation of
interests as a subjective criterion, and of achievement
as an objective test, Professor Small has
shown the dualistic nature of the social process.
Those methodologists who would measure all things
human in purely objective terms are scientifically
negligent of important human elements. Mind is
not simply matter; the social process is not entirely
behavior.</p>

<p>Professor Small has sharpened three important
tools for the use of the sociological investigator.
These are: the social process, personal interests,
and the group. His analyses are sound, except as he
does not show how “interests” usually possess social
origins. Otherwise he speaks consistently and
helpfully in terms of groups and group processes.</p>

<p>With concepts such as have been favorably presented
in the foregoing paragraphs—and chapters—the
sociologist of the future will be able to make
contributions to thought that will help to determine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
educational, religious, economic, political, and other
important human aims.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Dissemination of Sociological Thought</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>Despite its youth, inchoateness, and naïveté, sociological
thought is exerting a vital influence in the
world. It is giving a new rating to all the established
values of life, undermining some, strengthening
others, and creating still others.</p>

<p>The chief values in sociological thought are that
it constitutes the center of all worth while thought;
it gives balance and proportion to thinking in any
field; it defies race prejudice and social intolerance;
it smites selfish living; it rivets attention to the
essentially human values; it stimulates personal development
in harmony with group and societary
welfare. At the same time, it postulates group advancement,
not upon paternalistic or autocratic
grounds, but upon a constructive projection of personalities
that harmonizes with unselfish group
service.</p>

<p>For centuries genuine social thinking was confined
largely to a few of the intellectually élite.
These few lived, and did even their social thinking,
in a more or less isolated way. It was not until
the first decades of the last centuries that social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
thought began to be scientific in character, that is,
became sociological. Sociological thinking, however,
was isolated and uncorrelated for many years.
In the last decade of the nineteenth century, sociology
began to develop a considerable body of
thinkers and to create a new morale. There were
many disagreements that tended to break the new
science asunder. The opening decades, however, of
the twentieth century witnessed a development of
sociological thought that was followed by the establishment
of the teaching of sociology as a profession.</p>

<p>With the rise of professional sociologists, the
dissemination of socialized thought became noteworthy.
For a long time sociology was considered
only as a post-graduate study. In the last few years,
however, sociology has been making its way downward
in college and university curricula, until it is
being widely taught to college freshmen and sophomores.
In this connection there is a variety of textbooks
that have been written to meet the needs of
beginning students. There are some teachers who
would introduce sociology through anthropological
studies, beginning with the origin of man. Others
would give a survey or prospectus of social institutions,
processes, and problems.<a id="FNanchor_XXVIII-1" href="#Footnote_XXVIII-1" class="fnanchor">XXVIII-1</a> Still others would
deal only with social problems. Then there are
those persons who would build a text-book around
a central theme, tracing it through social relationships.
For advanced work in sociological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
thought there is a variety of treatises dealing with
systems at once profound, complex, and fundamental.</p>

<p>For high schools, the technique of sociological
teaching is in the beginning stages. The importance
in high schools of social science teaching is
generally recognized, but there has been great difficulty
in effecting an agreement among the various
social science branches. Some high school teachers
prefer a “social problems” course, although the demand
is growing for a “social science” course, extending
throughout the year, dividing the time more
or less evenly between economics, sociology, and
civics. There are other high school teachers who
contend that sociology can be taught best in a general
“citizenship” course. One of the specific difficulties
is that the high school curriculum is full, and
that the representatives of none of the established
courses are willing to see the subjects in which they
are interested crowded out. Another difficulty is
the power which the self-culture and self-development
concepts possess. The equal importance of
the social culture and social development concepts
is being recognized, but with amazing slowness.</p>

<p>In the grades the teaching of sociology is gaining
ground. In the sense that there is an advanced
group of mathematical studies for university men
and women and an elemental mathematics for the
grades, so there is advanced sociology, and also an
elemental sociology centering around the activities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
of the primary groups, such as the family, play,
neighborhood, and school groups. A child who is
old enough to learn to obey is old enough to begin
elemental sociology, in fact, when he learns to obey,
he is already beginning to experience the meaning
of a social, if not a sociological concept. Simple
social studies are being prepared for the grades,
even beginning with the first grade.</p>

<p>The dissemination of sociological thought is a
practical question to which in the last score of years
special attention has been given. The universities
and colleges began to establish chairs of sociology
in the closing decade of the last century. The movement
has acquired a remarkable momentum in the
United States. Normal schools and high schools
have adopted the movement. Many churches are
promulgating a socialized gospel. Literature is
gradually assuming an appreciation of the sociological
viewpoint.</p>

<p>From the social proverbs of primitive man to a
treatise such as Ross’ <i>Principles of Sociology</i>, with
its admirable analysis of significant societal processes,
such as equalization, domination, individuation,
socialization—this is the main span of social
thought. Social thought began in the simplest form
of observations about social relationships between
individual and individual, between chieftain and
tribal member, between master and servant. It experienced
various stages of denunciation of social
wrongs. It produced perspectives of perfect societies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
It moved profoundly forward in the form of
social philosophies. Now it is proceeding either
as the investigator of new social facts, or the psychological
interpreter of these facts in terms of
social processes. It is assuming a scientific procedure,
although a portion of the results of its
undertakings finds expression in social philosophy.
It is beginning to formulate sociological laws. It
is inaugurating a technique for preventing the maladjustments
that produce social evils; it is establishing
a teaching technique. Although the masses
of the human race are beginning to feel blindly the
meaning of social values, they have not yet been
able to make their highest social aspirations rationally
articulate. Until that time comes, democracy
will remain an experiment, and world progress a toy
of autocratic forces.</p>

<p>A history of social thought is essentially a review
of an irregular but positive acceptance of social
values. Individual after individual, leader after
leader, profession after profession, group after
group, have felt and accepted the challenge of the
sociological viewpoint. They have changed from
living selfishly to living socially. They have even
given up the ideal of service for self advancement,
setting up in its place the ideal of service for the
welfare of others. In so doing and living they have
found expansion of personality and contributed to
the advancement of society. Since the days of
Comte in particular, the social sciences have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
increasing in variety and scope until they number
a score or more, and sociological influence has been
widening until the related sciences are inviting sociology,
which is the scientific study of group phenomena,
to define their objectives for them. In fact,
sociological concepts are permeating the farthermost
reaches of personal living and societal control.
A history of social thought is a history of
the socializing of human attitudes and interests,
presaging a human society in which personal
achievement and group progress are equally and
supremely sought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Transcribers_Notes">Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Incorrect page references in the <a href="#CONTENTS">Table of Contents</a> were corrected.</p>

<p>The <a href="#index">index</a> was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_78">Page 78</a>: “fifty century” probably is an error for “Fifth century”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_287">Page 287</a>: Quotation beginning “the spur of all”
has no ending quotation mark.</p>

<p class="p2">Footnote numbers in this eBook were made
unique by prefixing the original
Arabic numbers with the Roman chapter numbers.</p>

<h3 id="missing" class="p2 in0 larger">FOOTNOTE ERRATA</h3>

<p>There are many mismatches and omissions between
the footnote anchors in the text and the footnotes
themselves. Some of them remain unresolved; the
Transcriber changed these:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Page_94">Page 94:</a> “2” ➝ “53”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_99">Page 99:</a> “78” ➝ “76”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_137">Page 137:</a> added “30”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_166">Page 166:</a> “25” ➝ “26”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_223">Page 223:</a> “32” ➝ “23”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_402">Page 402:</a> “12” ➝ “32”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_403">Page 403:</a> “38” ➝ “37”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_450">Page 450:</a> “14” ➝ “13”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_460">Page 460:</a> first “37” ➝ “36”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_462">Page 462:</a> “50” ➝ “40”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_466">Page 466:</a> second “43” ➝ “44”
</li>
</ul>

<p>These anchors appear to be either deliberate
duplicates or uncorrectable typographical or
placement errors:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Page_27">Page 27</a>: “5” refers to a non-existent Footnote</li>
<li><a href="#Page_70">Page 70</a>: “8”</li>
<li>Pages <a href="#Page_175">175</a> and <a href="#Page_177">177</a>: duplicate “4”</li>
<li><a href="#Page_285">Page 285</a>: “23”; <a href="#Page_288">page 288</a> is missing “23”</li>
<li>Pages <a href="#Page_459">459</a> and <a href="#Page_460">460</a>: “35” and “34” occur in reversed order</li>
<li><a href="#Page_460">Page 460</a>: “37”
</li>
</ul>

<p>These anchors are missing and no likely positions for them
could be identified:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Chapter_IV">Chapter IV</a>: “7”, “9”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_V">Chapter V</a>: “11”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>: “5”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a>: “10”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>: “11”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>: “9”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XVI">Chapter XVI</a>: “8”, “11”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>: “20”, “39”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>: “20”, “26”, “35”, “44”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XIX">Chapter XIX</a>: “8”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XXIII">Chapter XXIII</a>: “11”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XXVI">Chapter XXVI</a>: “38”</li>
<li><a href="#Chapter_XXVII">Chapter XXVII</a>: “1”</li>
</ul>

<p>These apparent footnote errors were corrected:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Page 498, <a href="#Chapter_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>: second Footnote “14” ➝ “15”</li>
<li>Page 499, <a href="#Chapter_XVI">Chapter XVI</a>: second Footnote “16” ➝ “17”</li>
<li>Page 503, <a href="#Chapter_XXVI">Chapter XXVI</a>: first Footnote “16” ➝ “15”
</li>
</ul>

<p>This footnote error was uncorrectable:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Page_501">Page 501</a>, <a href="#Chapter_XXII">Chapter XXII</a>: Footnote 32 is missing a page reference.
</li>
</ul>
